"It is quite a popular temple in the region. The deity is also known as Appanna locally.

Visited this temple way back in the late 1970s and remember climbing quite a few steps to reach the temple. But now vehicles are allowed right up to the temple.

The deity is supposed to be in the form of a wild boar head, human torso & lion tail but we could not see these features as the idol was covered with Sandal paste giving an appearance of Siva Linga. Understand once in a year one can see the deity on Akshaya Tritiya day with out any sandal paste.

We were lucky to see the temple from Sanctum Sanctorium. One can purchase the ticket for Rs 200. Photography is not permitted inside.

We are lucky to have visited this holy temple.",Simhachalam Temple

The powerful Narsimha Swamy,Simhachalam Temple
"This is a must visit temple for the Hindus. It hosts a Veda patashala and sends purohits to temples in various places.

The temple is atop a small hill and can be approached through several routes.

The crowd levels have increase significantly and the temple authorities have introduced a complex queue line system. All the space inside the temple has been taken up by long steel barriers. It is better to avoid weekends if you want to have a peaceful darshan. Elderly people better buy 100 darshan tickets to avoid walking long distance. Authorities should shorten queue system when the crowds are less. We were forced to walk for several hundred metres even there were no people ahead of us. It took us 15 min to reach the last of the piligrims ahead of us. Coconuts and Tulsi malas are not allowed inside the main deity. You will have to submit them to a small idol in the queue system only.

Getting a view of the idol compensates for all the trouble taken. Prasad was distributed on our bare hands though there were leaf cups available in the office. Drinking water system is available but not convenient.

Some piligrims put their arms around a pillar. They believe that if their fingers touch, they are blessed. Now a person asks you to embrace the pillar and ties a rope around for a few seconds and then collects money for that.",Simhachalam Temple

I would caution pilgrims to reach before 11:30 hrs otherwise the main gate is closed for 1hour when you have to wait in the queue to offer homage to Lord Narshimham.

Ancient Temple,Simhachalam Temple
"The Simhachalam temple is one of the most ancient temples, in Andhra Pradesh, situated. The place has a pleasant climate all over the year. The temple has an unique and agelong mythological background. The temple is neither disturbed not distracted from the agelong conventions, traditions, and ritualistic performances inspite of many economical, political or religious controversies or conflicts in the region.
It is an unparalled and uncomparable temple of its kind not only in the North Circars or Uttarandhra, but in the entire Telugu speaking regions. Though every village in the Telugu nadu is hailed at least by a small Rama Mandiram, the next place goes to Narasimha Temples. Most of them are happended to be ancient temples. In seemandhra, in Telangana, in Rayala seema, and even in the farther Southern regions, presence of a number of Narasimha Temples supports this statement

From days unknown till today a good number of functions like the annual, half yearly, quarterly, fortnightly, weekly and daily ritualistic functions are observed in this temple verbatim. The traditions and conventions stay very hard here and are never disturbed either by the day to day increasing flow of the pilgrims or by the local political disturbances. This ancient temple, which has undisturbed traditions and customs preserved for centuries together, has an, unparalleled and uncomparable place in the history of Sri Vaishnavaite cult.
The arrangements for worship in this temple are very good.One can have adivine experience if you visit in the mornings and Evenings.",Simhachalam Temple

Bathroom facility is in a different building, and another Rs 5 is charged for that. And water is only coming in wash basin taps. Very pathetic state of things.
Though on the other hand the Rs100 special darshanam queue was real quick. No stoppage, only your walking speed would decide. The prasadam sales counter was extremely crowded. I didn't dare to go in.",Simhachalam Temple
A full moon darshan,Simhachalam Temple

The drive up to the legendary Simhachalam Temple is beautiful and you will be awestruck when you reach up. The darshan is orderly and the place spotlessly clean.

There is a lot to see and do here. You will have to remove your shoes once you enter the inner sanctum. No photos allowed or any kind of back packs, etc. You will have to hire someone to watch your stuff or choose to stay outside. Expect huge crowds. You are pushing people all the time and it makes it difficult to enjoy what you're seeing. A guide is strongly recommended since there is so much to know that I cannot possibly cover here. We also watched the hair cutting ceremony that caused most little kids to scream their head off (you can take photos here .. .but always ask). Women are to be seen in gorgeous saris and many had great fun having their picture taken and we were often asked to be in one.

Decent Enough,Simhachalam Temple
"It is on top of the mountain. Few things people need to know,which I didnt and it costed me a hell lot of pain.

2. Its better to book a cab. It will go till the top. In case you do end up booking a auto, there is a bus service charging 15/head to ferry passengers to the top ,to the temple. avail that.

"At a distance of 18 km from Vizag Railway Station Simhadri or Simhachalam is a Hindu temple located in the Visakhapatnam City suburb of Simhachalam in Andhra Pradesh. This 11th century temple is dedicated to Sri Varaha Narasimha Swamy, an incarnation of Vishnu and situated on top of the Simhachalam Hills.
The temple is believed to have been constructed in 1098 by the famous Chola king, Kulothunga Chola. The queen of Kalinga gifted golden armor to the statue. The Eastern Ganga King Narasimha Deva has constructed the central shrine in 1267. Krishna Deva Raya, the Vijayanagara Emperor visited this temple in the year 1516, as seen from inscriptions here. The temple activities are managed by the Pusapati Gajapatis, for last three centuries.
The architectural of the central shrine follows Kalinga style. Facing towards west, it is a square shrine surmounted by a high tower, a portico in front with a small tower, a carved 16 pillared Natya mantapa. The shrine has inscriptions dating back to 1098 AD on its walls. The deity is always kept covered with sandal paste. The actual form of the deity is in the tribhanga posture with two hands & head of a lion, which can be viewed only during the 'Chandanotsavam' in April/May. Legend has it that the Ugra form of Narasimha as he killed the demon Hiranyakashipu was so fierce that the image is kept covered by sandal paste throughout the year.
Millions of devotees from around the country visit this temple every year especially during the Chandanotsavam Festival Season. On the annual ritual Chandanotsavam day, the Lord is covered with a new fresh layer of Sandalwood.
Road access is available to the hill top. Pilgrims can also take up the steps path to reach the temple. Simhachalam Devasthanam runs Simhadri Bus Service to take pilgrims to the hill top from the foothill And also there is a bus facility form RTC complex to simhachalm.

Visit to Simhachalam Temple and Visakhapatnam,Simhachalam Temple
"During my recent visit to Visakhapatnam, i stayed at a hotel in MVP Colony Sector 6 ( Venkoji Palem). Though this is not a peaceful or a place with lots of greenery, it was comfortable and convenient for a short stay with good places to Eat, Super markets etc. Public Transport is not very frequent. But this place is close to Venkoji Palem Bus Stop/ Petrol Bunk Stop, Venkojipalem on National Highway. Approx distance is 1.0 Km. I took a cab to Dwaraka Bus Stand and from there took an APSRTC bus to Simhachalam. From this place you will get a place to sit. Its comfortable journey of 1 hour and economical also. There are two routes to Simhachalam from Dwaraka Bus terminus. One route goes thru old city and another thru Venkojipalem. On the return journey i took a bus from Simhachalam Temple to Venkojipalem which runs along a broad highway with good breeze and no traffic. For darshan timings, pls check at 89127 64949 for current timings and time required for darshan. There are places on the hill for keeping our luggage, mobile phones etc. However did not see any good facility for refreshing ourselves on the temple hill. Better to have Vishakhapatnam as base and visit this temple. During up/down journey to the hill, views of the town are very soothing. If you go for General Darshan or Rs 20 ticket , you will pass thru few ceremonial halls which have excellent sculptures made out of hard rock. Food facility on this Temple Hill is very basic. On weekends and Holidays best time is to visit is early mornings by 10 AM, as after that crowds get larger and Darshan may take about 2 hrs time.",Simhachalam Temple

Great Narasimha Swami Temple in Visakhapatnam,Simhachalam Temple
"The great Narasimha Swamy temple located in the Simhachalam hills in Visakhapatnam just a few kilometers away from the Airport can be your first stop at Visakhapatnam. The temple is open between 5am and 7:30 pm and again for those who have missed the Darshan (view for worship) about 8:30pm. On all days you can worship the God covered in sandal. Thisbis because of his nature that he is being kept cool covered in sandal. Once in a year on Akshaya Tritiya around April the God can be seen in his original avataar called Nija Darshan. It takes about an hour or less on general working days to complete the darshan and see the temple. There are 2 ways to reach the temple atop The hill. A 4 km ride by road on your vehicle or the local busses available or a 1000 step walk taking you direct to the temple in about 40 minutes. Since the day of the God is believed to be Saturday you can expect a handsome crowd than other days. Feel is very good in front of the God. Should you wish a special Darshan you may buy a INR 200 ticket to get a closer darshan of God, else a free Darshan about a few yards away.",Simhachalam Temple

Being one of the few Narasimha Swamy temples in world, this temple has great architecture and power. The Lord here is covered with Chandan to calm his anger since the form here is Ugra Narasimha (Angry Narasimha) which is 4th avatar of Lord Vishnu. Every year, chandanotsavam is celebrated when the old chandan will be removed and new chandan is applied to the lord. Also, giri pradakshana (Pradhakshana to Hill) is also performed. Must visit religious place if you visit Vizag.",Simhachalam Temple
Matter of Faith but a different from most religious places in India,Simhachalam Temple
"This is an ancient Vishnu temple situated on Simhachalam hill close to Visakhapatnam.

Rest rooms / ticket / Prasadam counters are near parking place. One has to climb a number of steps to reach the main temple complex. However elders and physically challenged ones can use lift facility available by the side of Rajagopuram which is unique feature in this temple.

Temple is open for darshan from 5.30 am to 9 pm with a 30 minutes break from 11.30 to 12 noon and from 2.30 to 3.00 pm. General darshan is free, Special Daisha Rs20/- and Quick Daishan RS.100/-. During our visit on one of the evenings in April, not much crowd was there and Darshan could be had easily. Though the darshan are usually for few moments as the queue needs to move for accommodating more people, the Purohits there do not push or shout at you as can be a scene in many crowded temples in India.

The Deity here is Vishnu and worshipped as Varaha Narasimha. Vishnu is manifested here with a boar head, human torso and a lions tail. Except a single day in an year ie Akshaya tritiya, the idol is covered with a sandalwood paste through out the year and the purpose for that as per legend is to keep the whole city/area cool or away from unusual heat.

The visitors should not only focus to see the main deity but also look around for its exquisite sculpture. One of the most pleasant things I found about the temple was that purhotis (Pandas/priests) had not been forcing anyone to give money and their treatment for giving blessings to every one was totally unbiased apparently, an unusual sight in India.

It is matter of faith and belief but I would love to visit again for blessings!",Simhachalam Temple

"Very nice n scenery was gud.......................

Blissful,Simhachalam Temple
Varaha Narasimha the symbol of divinity might had manifested in a peculiar form on a mountain resembling a fort like structure with 3 courtyards and 5 gateways. The temple faces towards West instead of East. Had took not more than 10 minutes for darshan (prayers) during noon. Guess I was lucky. Word of caution for first time travellers is to avoid brokers who promises for quick visit. Also avoid donations to Priests who demand for money in sign language either in main hall (garbha gudi) or outside. Instead drop them in Hundi's (donation boxes) should you wish to contribute towards preservation of 9th Century AD Sanctum Santorum.,Simhachalam Temple
Peace..........,Simhachalam Temple
"Winding up a well maintained road, one enters the precincts of this peaceful abode of Lord Vishnu's Narasimha avataar. Lush green hills with a very well maintained temple. Senior citizens have an option of a lift as well. Still some steps would need to be climbed.",Simhachalam Temple
Very Spiritual,Simhachalam Temple
"One of the oldest temples and probably only one with ""two in one"" Avataras of Lord Vishnu. Approach is ok, but the road leading to the hill is congested. One can enter the sanctum santorum at a special price and offer shot puja (Ashtotharam) to the diety. Avoid 11AM- 12 noon as the darshan may not be allowed. The place is being developed oflate but still needs a lot to be done. Mobile phones are not allowed inside for darshan.",Simhachalam Temple

Beautiful Hill Temple !,Simhachalam Temple
"The presiding deity of this Temple is Sri Varsha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy, an avatar of Lord Sri Vishnu. The temple is built on a small hill lock and is simply beautiful to look at and is well maintained. Vehicles can go up to the temple entrance and lift facility is also available for seniors and special citizens to avoid climbing a few steep stairs near the entrance.

The temple deserves to be included in anyone's Vizag your programme and not to be missed to have darshan
of the Lord Lakshmi Narasimha and get His blessings. This temple is at the outskirts of Vizag city but with all the facilities available.",Simhachalam Temple
Fascinating and interesting,Simhachalam Temple
"I was fortunate to have the help of a kind gentleman who showed me where to deposit my phone, which route to take around the temple, what to do and what the background and history of the temple.

No photographs allowed. All cameras and phones are deposited outside the temple for a few rupees. You receive a token to retrieve your belongings later.

No shoes either. These are deposited beside your phones.

Crowds are huge. It is well worth your while to pay 100 rupees to take the express route.

Once you enter the compound, a labyrinth of passage ways lead you around gods and Poojas. I felt very privileged to be welcomed into what seemed like an inner sanctum and blessed. Everyone is extremely kind and patient.

I was given rose water to drink and an offering of saffron rice, nuts and spices.

This temple ( I was told) is frequented by businessmen all hoping to prosper under Lakshmi. It is an incredibly powerful temple and many a devotee vouch that prayers are answered.

Definitely not to be missed.",Simhachalam Temple

Ancient and very famous Temple,Simhachalam Temple
"The Shri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha temple situated on the Simhachalam hill, which is at a distance of ten miles to the north of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It is dedicated to one of the Hindu trinity deities Vishnu. As per the temple's legend (which is divided into 32 chapters), Vishnu manifested in this peculiar form, with a boar head, human torso and a lion's tail, after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter's father Hiranyakashipu. Except on Akshaya Tritiya, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is covered with sandalwood paste throughout the year, which makes it resemble a Shiva Lingam. A must visit while you are in Vizag",Simhachalam Temple

The Lord Vishnu temple,Simhachalam Temple
"This temple is on s hill and the entrance is bit far from the general bua stand. However private cars or bikes goes near the gate. There are free, Rs.20/- and Rs.100/- lines. The twenty rupees line was sufficient to reduce about one hour time when we visited. However all lines merge inside and you have about half minutes maximum to see the sandalwood paste covered deity. For a closer and special darshan, you need to pay Rs.200/- there to a priest.This ticket will entitle you to go inside and receive special blessings. Also you get two laddos at the counter by showing the Rs.200/- ticket stub. For more laddos you can pay there only.
The temple is very clean and well maintained.",Simhachalam Temple
powerful god and delighted experience,Simhachalam Temple
Its a very delighted experience to visit simhachalam temple near by vizag and got blessings of Lord VarahaNrusimha swamy. Everybody hindus visit here.,Simhachalam Temple
Very beautiful,Simhachalam Temple
"This is an important pilgrimage centre especially for vaishnavas. Nearly 19 kms away from Vishakhapatnam city proper the shrine of varaha Narasimha Swamy us easily accessible from railway station ( bus route no. 6 ) leaves you right at the doorstep of this famous hill temp1e. Youngsters can alternately climb from the base of simhachalam town. I visited the temple on a Monday band there was hardly any crowd. So could have a peaceful darshan of the lord that combines the features of Shri varaha and lord nrismha. The big image resembles that of lord Shiva. No pushing around I could stand before the deity for sometime and pray peacefully. The whole place is maintained extremely well. there are no proper eateries around', the one or two small shacks clearly lack hygiene.",Simhachalam Temple
Beautiful hindu temple dedicated to lord narsimha,Simhachalam Temple
"We visited this temple with my in-laws and the experience was lovely. It is situated on the top of simhachalam hill and is accessable by road using car/bike. Once you reach in front of its main gopuram ( the ornate enterance gate) you can buy Prasad ( they also distribute Prasad inside but you can buy from outside if you intend to take more for your friends and family). Buy the tickets ( I think it's special darshanam or something like that) for Rs.100 if you want to avoid an endless long line otherwise the other usual darshan is free. For those with any walking issues, there is a provision of an elevator on the right side of the main enterance which takes you straight to the enterance of main sanctum of the God. Try to follow the line even though many people don't do that once they are inside. If you have elderly or young children, make sure they stick with you because sometimes people pretty much push others around. Just follow the line and you may finally be directed out after seeing the main deity. The narsimha deity is about 2 ft tall and is covered in sandalwood paste.
Overall a very nice experience. Can sit outside and admire the architecture as well as the beauty of the hills around.
The temple remains very neat and clean.
Phones/cameras are not allowed and have to be kept in locker. There is no extra charge for lift use if the liftman feels that you may not be able to climb.( My father in law has a foot amputated so he and my mom in law could use the lift but me and hubby were asked to climb the stairs :) ) You can take water bottle inside. It is advisible to go here in the morning hours before 8-8:30 am to avoid rush. If you plan to have breakfast after darshan, you may have to come back to the city for it. It's perhaps the second most important shrine in Andhra Pradesh after tirumala. Do visit if you happen to be in Vizag.",Simhachalam Temple
A Very popular temple for Hindus,Simhachalam Temple
"It is considered to be the second best temple for Perumal in Andra Pradesh .
It is on a hillock and in a sprawling area with very good car parking facilities
We visited on the Pongal festival day when it was extremely crowded , still the temple administration has made very good arrangements for managing the devotees and providing good and faster Dharshan for all
It is a very sacred temple and I was surprised to see the idol of Varaga Narasimha Perumal presented in the shape of Shiva Lingam applying sandal paste over the original idol . This I understand is the case on most of the days in a year except few special days when you can see the original idol .
I was extremely satisfied and felt great inner peace after having Dharshan of the main deity",Simhachalam Temple
Divine abode of Lord Narasimha,Simhachalam Temple
"Went here as part of Vizag-Araku tour. Very picturesque locale, and fairly well-mentained temple. Of course the Lord was as always radiant in the brief, but impactful, darshan I had. Saw a couple of cows outside in a Go-shala, which looked quite rundown. Not sure if it was associated with temple, but wished it could be taken care of. Will research how to donate to that place, as nobody was minding anything about it.",Simhachalam Temple

"While I generally refrain from visiting religious places, family compulsions often mean that I end up at some important religious place. Visit to Vizag was no compulsion and I found myself at the Varahalakshminarashima Temple with family. The place is about 20 min drive from Vizag.

"The Simhachalan temple is an ornate shrine in the state of Andhra Pradesh. This ancient temple is dedicated to Lord Narasimha, who is an incarnation of Vishnu himself. The entire temple is embellished with extremely detailed stone carvings, which make it an architectural marvel. This is the only temple in the country where Shri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swami- who is a combination of the third and fourth incarnation of Lord Vishnu- appears. 

A temple which follows strict discipline, the Simhachalan temple has detailed prayer routines for all days of the year which are undisturbed by the influx of pilgrims. This place is a treasure of traditional Vaishnavite culture, and you can study the same in the routine of the temple and the various inscriptions that it houses. This temple has been a source of inspiration to many poets such as KuchimanchiTimma Kavi, Adidam Sura Kavi and the likes, owing to its rich history and strong traditional values. ",Simhachalam Temple

With more than 252 inscriptions in Oriya and Telugu describing the antecedents of the temple, it is a historically important monument.

Sri Krishna Deva Raya after defeating the Gajapati ruler of Orissa Gajapati Prataparudra Dev visited the shrine twice in 1516 AD and 1519 AD and offered numerous villages for maintenance of bhogam (worship) along with valuable jewellery of which an emerald necklace is still in the temple.

The other palaka was born as his brother Hiranyaaksha. Hiranyakasipu wanted to become immortal and hence performed austerities (tapasya) to propitiate Lord Brahma.

Highlight was the head shaving building, and talking to and taking photos of the newly married couples coming here for a blessing.",Simhachalam Temple

Bhagwan Vishnus temple is beautiful.. The area is well maintained. It is holy for all Hindus. So please visit this temple,Simhachalam Temple
Dedicated to Lord Narasimha,Simhachalam Temple
"Simhachalam Temple is located in the beautiful city of Visakhapatnam on a hill.The true meaning of Simhachalam is that Simha meaning Lion and Achala means A Hill.

Lord Narasimha, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu is the main deity of this temple. The Legend say that Lord Vishnu took this incarnation to demolish and kill the Asura Hiranyakashyap, the father of Prahlad.

Prahlad was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu and the demon Hiranyakashyp was a dead enemy of Lord Vishnu. He had attained a boon from Brahma that he should not be killed by a Man or an animal, neither in the day nor in the night..Vexed with his son's preachings, he tries to kill his son by giving poison, throwing from a top of the hill, through elephants but alas he survives because of the Grace of Lord Vishnu.

Prahlad says that Lord Vishnu is everywhere. So the Demon asks whether your Lord Vishnu is in the Pillar by hitting the Pillar. Then the Pillar breaks then, a Half Lion and a half man comes out which is none other than Lord Narasimha. He kills the Asura and crowns Prahlad as the King.

The deity, at this temple, is usually covered with sandalwood paste year round and can be seen without sandalwood ie ""Nijaroopa Darshan"" for only 12 hours per year. On Akshaya Tritiya Day,of Vaisakha, which generally falls in the month of May every year. Then the deity is re-covered with sandalwood paste.

Private cars can go upto the hill and there is vast place for parking of vehicles. There is Quick entry darshan for Rs. 20/- and special darshan for Rs.100. Inside the temple, archana tickets are sold at Rs. 200 ( two persons are allowed) where one can enter the sanctum and see the God from very close.

We visited this temple on 23rd February 2017 in the evening. It was pleasant and we had a very good darshan..",Simhachalam Temple

We went on friday mid morning hence skipped the crowd as well the queue. Serpentine Q complex gave us an idea what to expect on weekends and festivals. The temple complex is clean, well maintained and no touts to nag you. Once out after darshan one can avail both free and paid prasadam. Overall nice devotional experience.",Simhachalam Temple

Religious Rendezvous in one of its kind temple in India,Simhachalam Temple
"I have been a regular visitor to this temple for a long time , when I had hardly any good career or money and use to come down to Visakhapatnam 6 years back for offerring my deepest Puja and heartfelt prayers to Lord Narashimha.

Nestled in the hills right across the other side of the highway, the Lord Narashimha temple can be accessed by road in 45 minutes during heavy traffic and 30 minutes when there is hardly any traffic.

The beauty of this temple is the Simachalam hills which is serene and full of helpful people and staffs both in the temple complex and outside. The priests are humble and guide each devotee with prayers and offerrings.

The temple open @ 7 am in the morning and good for the pujas in the early hours of the morning.",Simhachalam Temple
Scenic location. Less crowded then other famous temples.,Simhachalam Temple
"We have visited the temple during off-season. The climate is cool and the breezes over the mountain are serene and very relaxing. I cannot speak from the Spiritual Angle, but from a tourism point of view it's better to visit this place when the climate is cool or normal.

Tips:
1. During off-season, there is absolutely no advantage for VIP tickets over 20 rupees tickets. But there is a slight advantage of distance between free entrance and 20 rupees tickets.
2. Butter-milk is sold here by various hawkers. Some people sell really tasty and cold butter-milk. Better to try freshly made butter-milk than packaged butter-milk.
3. 200 rupees tickets for Abhishekam are sold near the main sanctum sanctorium. It's worth it to try this as it offers spectacular views and some valuable time spent in the sanctum sanctorium with the Diety.",Simhachalam Temple

A must visit Tirupati like great temple in Simhachalam(Visakapatnam),Simhachalam Temple
"I have gone to Tirupati/Tirumala Balaji Temple several times. I had more or less the same feeling when I went to this temple, as this temple is also atop a hill, same such queue arrangements, same free food halls, same type Laddu prasadam. The difference is that, the main deity is Narasimha Avathar of MahaVishnu here and the Architecture of the temple is much more beautiful, highly intricate and artistic carvings of sculptures all over and of more heritage value. I loved those huge pillars beautiful carvings of identical beauty all round. Simhachalam is about 16 Kms from the City centre of Vizag. You can go by car or bus up to the temple.

There is a special pillar inside the temple called ""Srivari Kappasthambam"". At the bottom of this holy pillar is the sculpture of Santhana Gopalaswamy, carved. The strong belief is that those ladies who have no child and if they embrace this pillar will soon get conceived. Others too can do, to fulfil their wishes and embrace this Pillar. There are men and women in Queue waiting to do this.

it is a very nice and best temple I had visited in the recent times and is a must visit place when you are in Visakapatnam. Since I went in the Rs.100/- queue I was able to come out soon.There is Rs.20/-Queue and Free dharshan queue available.

the idol is normally covered in chandan as it is said it is a very ugra roopa and it is only removed for full darshan on thursday and the best time to be there is between 4-6 pm as you can stay inside the garbha griha for about half an hour to take darshan at ease.

There is a slight issue - you have to remove your footwear and leave your mobile phone with a chap at a counter.I'm a tad wary about leaving a shiny new iPhone with a chap I've never met in a shack! So, my mate and I took it one at a time to go around the temple. It was fairly busy but the fast track route probably saved 20 minutes.

An Amazing Experience,Simhachalam Temple
"The ancient temple of Lord Narsimha on the top of a hillock within the pristine beauty of mother nature ,is a must visit place if you are in Vizag. The temple architecture is a marvel of grandeur .I was amazed to see the intricate carvings on the temple pillars and became mesmerized by the skill of our ancient forefathers.
went twice to the temple.first time on 25th December, but could not enter the temple premise as there was a huge gathering of the devotees. but was lucky enough to see the aarti and procession with a huge bull outside of the temple wall.
Lord Narsimha was kid enough to let us enter at his adobe on 29th December. And we could offer puja to Lord with utmost satisfaction.
With the help of technology the temple administration is managing the systems with efficacy, though the ritualistic fervor remains untouched.that is the best part.",Simhachalam Temple
Narasimha Temple In a serene locale,Simhachalam Temple
"The drive uphill offered great views of the mountain and valleys. We went at a time when there was a huge crowd on the temple premises. Our driver told us to take 100 rs worth of passes as waiting time will be less, but seeing at the queue, even that option didn't look easy. We were suppose to travel to Ananthagiri the next day and we decided to come back to visit the temple after 3 days on our way back to Vizag from Ananthagiri, Second time we were lucky and there was no long queues and could get a good darshan.",Simhachalam Temple

"The temple is situated on a hill. Some Uber drivers take you up hill for an additional Rs.100, but ours did not. So we took the APSRTC Bus up and down the hill - One way fare : Adult - 10 and Child - 5.

We got the Rs.100 Spl darshan tickets, yet the darshan was not satisfactory. The priests inside allow you closer to the deity on paying an additional Rs.100, which is not fair.

I could hardly make out the deity except for an yellow oval shape, as I forgot to take my spectacles. My wife with perfect vision could also barely make out the deity!

The Rs. 200 ticket is highly recommended, if you can find where they sell them, as information is scarce to come by!

One way fare of the bus is RS 10 and runs after about 15 minutes.Still,after getting down from the bus you have to climb a good number of steps to reach the temple. The worshipped deity is Narasimha or half man, half lion, a incarnation of Lord Vishnu.The image is totally covered with sandalwood paste which is removed for 12 hours only on Akshay Tritiya day when a heavy rush of devotees take place I saw that garlands made of Tulsi(basil) are offered to the deity.After covering long stretch of lanes, one can reach the main temple.However, you are not allowed to see the deity from close proximity For this, you are to shell out Rd 500 to Purohits.The temple was constructed in 13th century and is of Oddisi architecture.There are many inscriptions which could not be read by me.Many parts of the main structures are in decay and is being restored by Archeological dept It takes about 2 hours to complete the darshan of the total complex on a day when there is no rush.",Simhachalam Temple

As per rule, no camera or mobile phones are allowed in the temple and you also have to remove your shoes and get inside the temple bare footed. Just as an advice, if you are a traveller without much time in hand to stand in the queue, go for the special queue where per head ticket charges are 100/- and this bypasses the typical long queue of visitors and puts you directly on the front gate of the temple. Inside the temple is an idol of Lord Narasimha and several other sculptures and work of art.",Simhachalam Temple

Famous temple and historical temple in Vizag,Simhachalam Temple
"Its a very historical temple located on the top of a hill. Good transportation facilities are available to reach the hill top which is around 6-7 km. Lord Narasimha swamy is worshipped who is covered with Sandalwood paste all through the year. Only during the month of May, we can have the real darshan of the Lord.

Hail Lord Narsimha!!,Simhachalam Temple
"It was the first place we visited as we reached Vizag and we wanted to start with taking blessings from the reigning deity of Vizag, Lord Narsimha.

The drive to the temple was scenic and quiet. As soon as we reached around 11.45 am the security guards as to rush inside as the temple would close for the afternoon, so make sure to check the timings before visiting.

No phones or cameras are allowed inside the temple and hence has to be left outside at the stand.

There are two lines to the temple one which is free the next where you are charged Rs 20/ pp. Both the lines end up at the same place but the chargeable line gets you to the sanctum faster as you are not passing through the snake like queues.

Very well maintained and clean, with no Pandits bothering you like the other big shrines.

Definitely not to be missed when in Vizag.",Simhachalam Temple

And what is the fun if the guards there push every1 to just move fast. They don't even care for woman, children or elder people. They have coupon system for entering and so many different schemes.

Divine Duty Calling,Simhachalam Temple
"Simhadri or Simhachalam is a Hindu temple located in the Visakhapatnam City suburb of Simhachalam in Andhra Pradesh, South India. It is dedicated to Narasimha (the man-lion), an incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu. The temple is situated among hills covered with cashew trees, shrubs, and mango groves and adds the green lusture all around.

My visit to the temple was not as a tourist. Though I have spent 4 years in Visakhapatnam I visited the temple only once as one of friend stayed very close to it. The visit to the temple is no different than any other Hindu temple. Language of money is prevalent here and if you can splash a couple of hundreds you are treated like a VIP. While I am not an atheist but the way management committees handle the temple affairs across the country it literally pisses me off. I mean; to meet your own creator you have to shell out money which is just out of my understanding.

Overall one out of the thousands of temples dedicated to Hindu Gods and Goddesses. Worth a visit.",Simhachalam Temple

Inticately carved and well-organised for visitors,Simhachalam Temple
"In the past I have never been very comfortable in Hindu temples because they're so crowded and I wasn't sure if I was really welcome. On this occasion we went with my father-in-law whose from Guntur and that resolved the uncertainty about where you could go and what was acceptable behaviour. Plus all the visitors were directed to follow a set route. The really good thing about this is that you've got no choice where you go so when you pass thru the inner sanctum that's clearly okay.

The carvings are intricate and absorbing apart from the broken bits that mostly appeared to depict sex and I presume were probably destroyed by Christian missionaries. This was my favourite cultural experience in Vizag and I recommend a visit.",Simhachalam Temple
A very Pious Place,Simhachalam Temple

"Divine, Historic & a bounty of solace",Simhachalam Temple
"The Hill is a wonder in itself. The presiding deity is Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy, clad in loads of Chandan all the year throughout, but for a single day i.e. Akshaya Trutiya day in the Visakha masa. The Nija Rupa of the deity can be seen on that particular day only. The deity is a manifestation of Lord Vishnu in two Avatars - Varaha & Nrusimha. Though the exact age of the temple & shrine remain yet to established with authenticity, inscriptions & Archaeological evidences suggest almost a 1000 years history.

The temple is adorned with rich architecture and has been the recipient of patronage from all the Rulers of this region. It is well accessible from almost any part of Visakhapatnam. If time permits, one can venture around to visit the natural springs on the hill and have a shower underneath them too. One of such spring can be found on the Stairway.

Trekking up the (around 1100 steps) stairway is indeed a good way to reach the temple. There is a fantastic ghat road, about 5 km long, to reach the temple. Buses of APSRTC ply from few locations (Dwaraka Bus Station Complex, both gates of Visakhapatnam Railway Station, RK Beach etc,) directly to the hill top and the foothill as well. The Devasthanam also plies regular shuttle buses from the Hilltop and back.

In case, you use personal private conveyance to reach the hilltop, do make sure that you stopover at least at a couple of places, while returning and spend few minutes for yourself. The views are simply amazing & you would not forget them for a long time. But a word of caution:: the ghat road winds through a forest famous for deadly snakes & leopards.

The shrine is usually crowded during the mornings on Saturday & Sunday & also on Ekadasi day. A must see during your trip to Vizag.",Simhachalam Temple
One of the Best Devine places to visit in Vizag,Simhachalam Temple
"The Historic Temple at the Simhachalam, built in the 11th Century, where the Lord Varaha Narasimha Swami's temple is located, resembles the rich cultural heritage Visakhapatnam holds.

This great temple built in the 11th century by the King Sri Krishnadevaraya, is one of its kind in the country.",Simhachalam Temple
Beautiful surroundings but the planning is not.,Simhachalam Temple
"The surrounding, the journey, the atmosphere...everything is marvellous! But the ticketing system needs to be addressed.
We went there with APTDC daily tour. The guide asked us to leave our bags in the bus, and we did. I was with my camera and my wife was empty handed. I preferred to stay outside, and my wife decided to go in. But upon entering she found there was some entry fee for the inner part of the temple. Had the ticket counter been in the open, she could have avoided some uncanny situations.",Simhachalam Temple

How to Rob Heritage,Simhachalam Temple
"While returning from Kondakarla Bird Sanctuary , we paid our tributes to the fusion God Varah Lakshminarsimha in tribhanga posture residing in a hill top temple combining features of Chalukyan and Orrissan features of temple architecture and displaying a beautiful stone chariot drawn by horses . The image of the Lord resembled a Shivlinga covered with sandal paste . We were told that the idol represented the fierce form of Narsimha when he killed Hiranyakashyapu and hence it is kept cool under the sandal wrappers through out the year , except on Akshay Trutiya when the layers were removed and the brave devotees could pay their obedience .

Sheshashayee Vishnu with his Lakshmi was shown on Viman Gopur . For the second time we saw Lord Vishnu sitting on the throne made by Shesha . The first occasion was at Sree Ananth Padmanabhaswamy Temple at Ananthapura in Kasargod District , Kerala . Narsimha was depicted in several forms . In one He was shown tearing the stomach of Hiranyakashyapu placing him on his bent right thigh . In other He placed him , holding a dagger in his right hand ,across his two legs to dispatch him to Yamlok .

Lord Vishnu was aesthetically and beautifully depicted in His Dashavaatars . Intricate stone carvings were abundant on the outer walls of the temple . In one such carving of Kalpwruksha , Lord Buddha was shown meditating .

But alas , one of the most beautiful temples was deprived of its rich heritage by hiding the unparaller art behind the covers .",Simhachalam Temple

Excellent road from Vishakapatnam to Simhachalam,Simhachalam Temple
"Mobile phones are not allowed inside the temple premises. The temple authorities have put up this display only near queue entrance which is about 200 feet away from parking area.

In July, weather was so hot that we could not place our bare feet on road (literally). Wearing socks may help, but haven't tried it personally.

There are three entrances, Rs. 100, Rs. 20 and free entrance. All the entrances will take you only up to a point from where the group gets mixed and move towards the deity. If you want to cut short your time, Rs. 20 line is ideal.

Avoid buying Tulsi or any garlands from vendors who will pester you in queue. The temple priests will not accept it and so you will have to be satisfied in garlanding statues in periphery yourselves.

Temple ladoo is very famous. Don't miss it. Also, don't miss to get Annadana Prasadam.",Simhachalam Temple

"After a long time i entered into the temple,which is modernized,Simhadri or Simhachalam is a Hindu temple located in the Visakhapatnam City suburb of Simhachalam in Andhra Pradesh, South India. It is dedicated to Narasimha (the man-lion), an incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu. The architectural style of the central shrine is Kalinga architecturei like stone throne behind the temple and wooden chariot, ""Simha"" means lion; ""Adri"" or ""Achala"" means hill. The temple is located at the top of a hill; hence the temple is called Simhachalam. Sri Varahalakshmi Narasimha Swamy, the lion-man incarnation of Lord Vishnu, is the presiding deity of the temple.

"When you are in vizag its a must that you visit the famous temple . Simhachalam which is about 21 kms from Novotel hotel can be reached in about 35 minutes flat. Ideally you start at 6.45 am from the hotel and reach temple at 7.20 and have your darshan at ease. between 6.30 to 7.00 am the temple is shut for public which means it will b crowded upto 7.30 am. After which its free, but by 8.00 am the crowd starts building up and u may have a long Q. We hired a taxi for approx rs 800/- for a 4 hour package, but i found out that u can b back in 1hr 45 minutes if u follow the above schedule.",Simhachalam Temple

a holy place where you can see the original beauty of the diety for only 12 hours in a year.,Simhachalam Temple
"Simhachalam or simhadri is situated about 15kms from the city vishakapatnam. frequent buses are there to the temple area. the diety worshipped is SRILAKSHMI VARAHA NARASIMHA. But we can see only the sandalwood paste covered diety in the form of a sivalinga. the original form can be seen only on the Akshaya Trhithya day, that too for only 12 hours. the temple is built as per the agama shastras, and the Rajagopuram is really a beauty. But, the arrangements are pathetic as there is no counter you can get the informations required and perform your sevas. within the temple, there are on the spot counters, where you can get hardly any information. but you pay, and have darshan of the lord. this is one field where lot of inprovements are required, to keep up the sanctity.",Simhachalam Temple
Secret route to Simhachalam,Simhachalam Temple
"In the late 80s, my dad was posted to Vizag, a very sleepy little but beautiful town then.The Rishikonda beach and road used to be deserted. The road to the zoo was beautiful and empty. It was then that dad discovered, that at the bottom of the hill, opposite to where the Simhachalam is located, there is a very small but ancient shrine. The hill was forest covered, but steps led up to the hill from the shrine and went all the way up and over the peak to Simhachalam temple. We trekked up that path quite a few times.It took about 2-3 hours one way. A beautiful climb the through the hill and forest. We would set off really early, visit the temple, rest and have lunch and then climb down. I was in 7th grade, my sister in third. Often the only other person we would see on the climb would be a woodcutter or some local tribal person. No one we knew in Vizag knew of this path. Its also amazing to think we 2 girls went through a jungle with our dad and felt safe - somehow its not a risk I would take with my kids. India has changed so much. But anyways, any young students reading this should explore this route, it was great!",Simhachalam Temple

The Kalyanotsava of Lord with His consort goddess Laxmi will be celebrated on the beautifully decorated Natyamandapam on the north side of the temple. You can count 96 pillars of black stone, arranged in sixteen rows of six each, to support this Mandapam. The speciality of the carving on these pillars is that one is not similar to other.

The most important place to visit in Visakhapatnam,Simhachalam Temple
"Here is a temple, 3rd richest Hindu Temple in India. After Tirupati, Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple, Kerala. You can know more about the temple and it's history here on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simhachalam.

It was built on top of a huge range of hills, way back 1000's of years ago and located near by Gopalapatnam, Visakapatnam.

You can go for Darshan for free or by paying a Rs.100 for Darshan. Which takes less time. After Darshan, make sure to have Laddo and Puliharam (The yellow rice) as prasadam, which is sold at a huge outlet out side the temple premises. I am sure you will love the Puliharam. You can easily reach here from any part of the city using APSRTC Buses.

If you intend to visit this temple and want to stay for a day in an hotel, please look for an hotel in city, as the hotels near by temple area arent upto the mark. City hotels would hardly be 15kms away from the temple. Where as the temple is around 8kms away from Visakhapatnam Airport.",Simhachalam Temple

Old Stomping Grounds!!,RK Beach
Visited Vizag after over 20 years. Was there mainly to watch the India vs SA cricket test match. Was very happy with the way the RK Beach area has been developed. It is fairly clean and the Submarine and TU142 aircraft museums add to the beauty of the area. Hope they keep it that way.,RK Beach
Very nice but swimming,RK Beach
"This beach is nice for the view and walk along the beach road. Swimming here is not the best thing to do. The long beach has got many other attractions, recreational activities, palm trees, and other spots of interest.

A memorable experience overall. I would suggest a walk along this beach in the late afternoon to have the best experience.",RK Beach

The main attraction of Vizag,RK Beach
"It is a must visit for any tourist to Vizag. The Temple and institution of RKM is the olden establishment on this area. Slowly the developments and constructions for hotels, resorts, restaurants, museums, amusement parks, commercial buildings overshadowed the original calm and quite serenity of the area and today it has become the most popular business district of Vizag.",RK Beach
RK Beach,RK Beach

A Clean Beach for a good outing,RK Beach
"Why beaches of Vizag and particularly RK beach stand out, is for their cleanliness. They are a good family outing.

A Surprisingly Clean Beach,RK Beach
"This is a wide, sandy beach about a couple of kilometres or so from the centre of Town. There are outcrops of rocks at parts of the shoreline and it is popular with visitors and locals alike. It is impressively clean given the number of day trippers who venture there.

We visited on 16 December 2018, the day before Cyclone Pethai was due to make landfall and found TV crews aready waiting and reporting on its progress. The Cyclone arrived on 17th December as expected but left very little damage at this part of the coast.",RK Beach

4. Food joints

Bad points:
1. Extremely crowded
2. Women have to be careful because some cheap men may stare you a lot or even follow you.",RK Beach
Just an average beach,RK Beach
Nothing spectacular about the beach itself. It is overcrowded but with good sea breeze. The submarine is worth looking at,RK Beach
Beach,RK Beach
It is one of the beach in Visakhapatnam. It is best place to refresh. When I was tired then I visit this place. And the beach road is so beautiful.,RK Beach
"Central, dirty and lively",RK Beach
"This is the main and most central beach in Vizag, sandy and long with very scenic rocks and a good views of the city's seafront, from the port with its huge cranes to the south to the hills and promontories to the north.
There are plenty of statues, colourful murals, stalls selling souvenirs and snacks and the area really comes alive in the evening when locals come here to enjoy the breeze, socialize, eat and be merry.
Unfortunately the beach is very dirty and at times very smelly (sewer water?) so I think the best option is to walk along Beach Road and enjoy the view from a distance rather the go on the beach itself.
As it is customary on most Indian beaches, no swimsuits, no swimming, no water sports (though if you wear a t-shirt a dip in the sea is OK)",RK Beach
Rama Krishna Beach,RK Beach
Rama Krishna Beach popularly known as the RK Beach is the main beach in Vizag and is centrally located. As a consequence in the evenings it is pretty much crowded with the locals enjoying themselves.,RK Beach

A pleasant stroll,RK Beach
"A great place for a pleasant stroll along the beach front, snack stalls and other attractions are plentiful",RK Beach
Easily accessible. Hence overcrowded.,RK Beach
"This beach stands right in the heart of the bustling city. With tiny shops, hotels, and restaurants all around. So expectedly, this beach is particularly crowded. With day-trip and excursion groups visiting in large buses, loads of cars, bikes and all that. This slightly reduces the natural charm, if you are looking for some peace and solace. For family and friend time, this could be a good place. With loads of fun activities and eating options all around. I was on a solo business trip and needed to clear my head after a long (and hectic) day. Tenneti park (and beach) is way better, though its far from the main city.",RK Beach
Nice place to hangout at evenings,RK Beach
"Developed by VUDA, a nice & cool place to hang out in evenings. It is surrounded by lot of restaurants, street chats. Nearby there is a matsyalaya. Few water sports options are available. Even Bean bags are available to sit and enjoy the beach view.",RK Beach
Beautiful beach,RK Beach
The RK beach in Visakhapatnam is the best I have visited so far to spend valuable time and enjoy the surroundings. The beach has enough parking space for cars and two wheelers and besides relaxing near the beach one can spend time in visiting the submarine museum and the museum housed in re assembled fighter aircraft. There are umpteen choices for a family to enjoy in the beach area besides a number of restaurants to take care of your hunger. Ramakrishna Beach is a must visit when you are in Visakhapatnam,RK Beach
Busiest beautiful beach,RK Beach
"Most favourite and best past time is RK beach aka Ramakrishna Beach, evenings the beach usually crowded by visitors and locals to enjoy the breeze and sea view. There also lots of sea facing restaurants and street vendors to add on with munching along with enjoying the sea view and breeze. It is not advisable to venture into the sea and careful caution should be taken if done so, specifically for children. Also in beach road we have Air & Submarine museum, and Fish aquarium.",RK Beach

"Rama Krishna Beach or RK Beach as it is popularly known, is a major tourist attraction in Vishakhapatnam city. Large no. of tourists visit this beach everyday, as there are other attractions like Kursura Submarine Museum, Vishakha Museum, Ramkrishna Mission etc. in its vicinity. Unlike beaches elsewhere, this beach is situated in the heart of the city (only 4-5 kms from the Railway station) and is therefore easily accessible. Plenty of eateries on the beach road cater to the visitors to the beach. The beach needs improvement in its cleanliness.",RK Beach
Dirty beach,RK Beach
"Too dirty Beach, don't bath here, no guards, no warnings, child park is best for families, Frontside too much good restaurants, novatel building is versatile to see, many food vendors on beach, economical food, must try porns, bhel and other items.

Beauty of vizag,RK Beach
"Just overlooked by novotel Vizag, it is the most historical beach of vizag. Always a bustling place with crowd in all seasons.cleanliness still needs to improve but Vmrda has bettered it by cementing and also providing plenty of parking space just adjacent to it. But swimmer's beware.. It is very deep and and dangerous due to underwater rocks and sudden tides..to wet your feet, ride on camel and horses... It's perfect",RK Beach
Okay Type,RK Beach

Full of activity- good for walk,RK Beach
This beach is for a morning or evening walk. This is fully crowded and get explore roadside vendors. Also other tourist attractions are few meters away. But not good for getting into water as beach is very dirty.,RK Beach
Best place to relax by looking at the busy crowd.,RK Beach
RK Beach is always one of the must visit place of Vizag. Always crowded with tourists but one can just sit there and relax by looking at sea one side and busy crowd passing by on the other. This is where all public events of Vizag happens. Newly planted old coconut brought new look to RK Beach.,RK Beach
RK beach.,RK Beach
"A walk early in the morning along RK beach is an absolute one to start a day with. The fresh and breeze is an experience to feel and cannot be put in words. Good to boost energy. Whenever, I visit vizag, I try my best not to aviod the morning walk at RK beach. During the day time, one can visit Vishalakshinagar, which is on a small hill. There is park, ropeway, a big Lord Shiva statue and one can have a beautiful view of whole Vishakapatam from this place. And again in the evening one can go to RK beach and join the crowd there. There are quite good number of small eating places, mostly junk food, which can be tried. Can spend time easily till 9 to 10 pm in the evening with the family.
While staying n vizag one can try tge sea food there which is available in many places.",RK Beach

"I was on a trip to Bangalore and had a halt at Vizag. Decided to visit RK beach which i heard a lot about. It was just 30 mins from Airport. Nice place. well kept. Adjacent to the beach road. Great view of the open ocean. Very peaceful too. We could see huge ships anchored at distance. Was lucky to see a diesel submarine also! We reached there in noon so it was not crowded. Couldn't get the see the Submarine Museum as it opens at 2 PM; We left before that; There was am option to lie down at Sunbatch chair (cushioned); they charge Rs 30 for an hour. No liquor is permitted there. But you can sneak it in from a nearby shop and drink silently, i heard..

Overall the view was great! Wind was blowing nicely and it was cool.

Great Experience.",RK Beach

One of the Good beach of Vizag,RK Beach
"It is known as R K Beach, it is in the center of the city, They call it Beach area, Beach is good, but people of Vizag do everything to make it a dirty place, I have seen local people throwing litter at the beach. But still one can enjoy at the beach.....get your beach wear ready",RK Beach
Good Experience,RK Beach
"The R.K.Beach is the most popular beach among the lot. The issue is though that the beach road that goes by the RK Beach has only a a handfull of hotels.
Most of the buildings are residential complexes. So the charm and beauty of having a beach view room is a bit difficult coz of the lack of options.

The beach itself is very clean. The road by the beach has very wide and well maintained footpaths for people to walk and jog.
The roads are closed for vehicle till 76.30am as people walk and jog. Even I took part during my stay.
Quite a few restaurants are available and swiggy and zomato is available in plenty in the nearby hotels.",RK Beach
Nice place to hang with friends,RK Beach
"Ramakrishna beach is the principal beach of Vizag though we have other beaches like Yarada and Rushikonda. Beautiful road at the shore makes it very attractive to tourists. Bhajji, sodas, ice creams from roadside counters are not to be missed. We have kurusura submarine museum, various parks, statues of great leaders, recent addition is of aircraft museum and I Love Vizag caricature. Nice ice cream parlours, shopping places and Maa Durga temple also are on the beach road. Nice place to visit. Not to be missed. One can play in the sand but risky to go inside the water. Please avaoid going into the water but you can drench your feet with water carefully.",RK Beach

"Had been to this beach for a morning jog. Municipal corporation has done a great job by constructing and maintaining all around the beach. Even public toilets are in place..
Yet as usual we and our country men take pleasure to use the beach as a public toilet for both types of excretion.

A crowded and unclean beach located adjacent to Marine Drive type road with few other nearbtourist places worth visiting,RK Beach
"This beach is arguably the most popular beach in Visakhapatnam and one can always get huge crowd in the beach. The beach indeed is unkempt and does not has good hygienic eatery options other than puffed rice, ice creams, coconuts etc.

From safety point of view, there are multiple rocks on the beach which makes swimming risky..at the same time the sand keeps on slipping underneath and so one, especially children and women, should be careful, while swimming

Rama Krishna (R K) Beach is full of crowd and one would never feel lonely there. There are also multiple hotel options, cheap and costly both, in very close proximity.

Pros
Good view of the sea
Relaxing in nature and a popular hangout place
Good connectivity with city bus, ola and uber
Tourist attractions like Submarine museum, aircraft museum, fish museum (Matsyadarshini), Kali temple, Doll museum in walking distance
Multiple restaurants nearby

Cons
No sitting option
Very limited food options at the beach
Beach with rocks
Needs regular cleanliness and maintenance",RK Beach
Crowded & dirty beach,RK Beach

"Rama Krishna Beach, the best part of Visakha.",RK Beach
"This is a must visit place for all visitors to Visakhapatnam. The name came due to the existance of Rama Krishna Mission, nearly 80 years. It is still exists and many visit the Ashram. They maintain a Temple, guest houses and a Library. The beach is beautiful. Many people walk on beach road. In the morning the road blocked for vehicular traffic between 0500AM to 0730 AM, to facilitate pollution-free walking.

It has a beautiful Durga Temple.

There are decent Restaurants and places for children activities. Rama Krishna Beach has Submarine Museum and Aircraft Museum.

One can taste many local snacks from small vendors, especially PIDATHA KINDA PAPPU.

Come any enjoy !!
But keep it clean !!",RK Beach
Rusty playing items.,RK Beach
"Had been there with my 4 year kid and was a bit suprised to see that the playing items like childrens slide, sea saw ect are not well maintained and a bit rusty as well. It would be good if there is a bit more of greenary. As it is located just beside mainroad, thare is a chance of pollution which is not good for kids. Overall, good time .for kinds for 30 to 45 mins.",RK Beach

Nice beach,RK Beach
Beach is maintained quite well but was expecting it to be more cleaner. Took a long walk in the evening and observed that the cops were taking rounds and patrolling on their bikes for the safety of people which was impressive.,RK Beach
Very disappointed with the upkeep of the beach,RK Beach
"We were excited to see the Rama Krishna beach after a gap of 15 years but were truly disappointed to see how badly it is maintained by both the residents and the local authorities. It is sad to see such a magnificent beach being destroyed by people who throw litter where ever they feel like all along the beach.

What is even more shocking is the open defecation that the men folk indulge in. It is so sad to see this happen even after our Central and State Govts plead for 'Swach Bharat"" almost every day :-( -:(.

The only solace was that we could enjoy the morning walk along the footpath of the Rama Krishna Beach but we were just heartbroken to see the beach in such a sad condition. We did manage to walk on the beach alongside the magnificent waves but I don't think we will be motivated to visit this beach again unless it is properly maintained!

Cheers",RK Beach
Nice,RK Beach
Nice beach with the public of Visakhapatnam is a very famous ship and the war ships enjoyable and extraordinary of the Visakhapatnam,RK Beach

Beach with a Open Gym & View,RK Beach
"I was in Vizag for a night for business and stayed in a hotel bang opposite to the hotel.
R.K. Beach is nearly 2km long beach, little rocky, not meant for swimming, but suitable for walks and exercise.
Morning breeze, sight of Sun rising and hundreds of people of all ages, sizes and shapes walking / jogging all along, makes a pleasing sight and motivates you.

Along the beach there is wide pavement for pedestrians and also a few play grounds and open gym to stretch your self.

It was a pleasure being there to breathe fresh air before starting your day for official activities.",RK Beach
Nice beach facing Bay of Bengal but unclean & untidy,RK Beach

Fun Beach in Vizag,RK Beach
Ram Krishna Beach is about 7-8 Km from Yatri Nivas Haritha Hotel and about 4.5 km from Vizag railway station. Go there by auto via the Beach Road. Auto on Reserve generally takes 100 INR to 150 INR.

Evening Solace,RK Beach
The prime beach of the city. It is a clean beach with lovely surroundings. the kali temple is nearby.,RK Beach
The most popular beach in Vizag,RK Beach
Very populated in the evening when local people and tourists alike cone to enjoy by the sea. This naturally creates a lot of plastic and other waste. The sweeper ladies are continually working to keep the beach and promenade clean. Fast food and snacks stalls are there on the beach as well as on the opposite roadside. The beach is NOT suitable for bathing due to hidden rocks underneath. There are bathroom and toilets available on the beach. One must spend a great evening here. Bus is available from beach road to most location of the city.,RK Beach
"Dirty, bad and cluttered",RK Beach
"I had so much expectations from this beach. One of the three beaches that we visited on a day. Given that it is within the city limits, I now understand why it is not the cleanest beach out there.",RK Beach

Beach Requiring Cleaning!,RK Beach
It is not a safe beach for swimming. I strongly urge and advise all to remember this. Our East coast of India becomes abruptly deep and so it is dangerous. It is a wonderful beach for walking and listening to the ocean. The traffic police does a wonderful job of closing the road morning up to 7:00 AM for those interested in walking. That is great. I also saw a lot of vendors with healthy drinks and so on. All very good. But when I compare with similar beaches abroad I am saddened to see lack of hygiene. It needs a lot more work to clean and beautify it.,RK Beach

"It's a beautiful place to visit you have good amount of place to sit and chat, Street food, small restaurants, bus facility, parking facility (paid and non paid), 5 star hotels, submarine museum and recently aeroplane museum going to establish etc.
The only drawback is that the cleanliness part at some areas you can find sand colour changed to black that's because of drainage or burning waste.
Still then you can avoid such place and be at nicely developed area for sitting and chatting.",RK Beach

All city attractions are located along the beach view, the beach has many attractions like Boat ride, submarine ride, Swimming pool, shopping area available in the beach with tasty food of local made varieties and maintained well. I enjoyed the beach very much by getting into it and then entered into the Icon multi-mall which very near to it. This beach has boat ride for 50/- by the local people with their boats only but the shops here are fulfilled with sea variety materials especially chains, lockets and I recommend everyone to visit this beach in early evening and visit other attraction near to beach with in visit to Vizag like Aquarium house, Kalika Temple, Vuda Park, when visited with kids especially.",RK Beach

Lovely wide-Long-Clean Beach,RK Beach
"We went in the month of June 2017 with my family. It was hot. The beach is very long and you can have all sort of fun. You can enjoy the sea water with the crowd or select you empty space. Opposite the beach if you cross the road you can find lot of good fast food. Most important the beach is clean. In short you can spend a whole day in and around the RK Beach, If you travel by car you can realise how long the beach is and also the view is nice. I will definitely visit again.
Bye.",RK Beach
Pleasant,RK Beach

Well maintained public beach,RK Beach
"In India most beaches are public places for relaxation, walking and eating. The RK beach is the cleanest city beach I have come across. The walkways and access have been well organized and kept clean. This is one of the few places where you don't find trash piled up or littered with paper and plastic. There is a cool breeze coming from the sea and lots of length between the road and the beach earmarked for walking. Overall a nice place to relax in the evening or night. Several eating places are also available around here.",RK Beach
Beautiful Coastline,RK Beach
"The RK beach coast line is a beautiful stretch for approx 35 to 40 Kms. We can certainly enjoy a morning jog, cycling, walking with families and the weather is really lovely and we live here so i can only i absolutely love it.

Not a great beach,RK Beach
"NOt a great beach to go to. Being in the city limits, it is pretty dirty and crowded.
Lots of stalls around dirtying the place.

Be careful, its a really rocky place and you might hurt yourself. Also the place has lot of broken glass pieces. Beware.

Additionally there is a great problem of parking around.
CAN be max a one time visit.

Try out the beaches on the rishikonda -bimli road.",RK Beach

Breath of Fresh Air,RK Beach
"This long beach front road, which is rather reminiscent is Marine Drive in Mumbai, is a great place for a nice long refreshing walk with the soothing sea breeze and clean air. In fact the only kind of 'pollution' this place suffers are the vehicular sounds and some of the statues dotting the area, which are eyesores (e.g. the one pictured alongside this attraction's tripadvisor profile).",RK Beach

It is also very close to the submarine museum.
Visitors to Vizag must come to RK beach at least once.
Our visit here a few days back is really memorable thanks to the first shower of the monsoon.",RK Beach

My view,RK Beach
Heard a lot about this beach RK beach. Dirtiest beach. Can't seat on the sand. Nothing there to enjoy.,RK Beach
I went for exam and post exam I just went to relax the stress,RK Beach
"I felt like loosing myself seeing the waves. Flow of water .. dipping legs and fingers, beach cricket by local boys on holidays. Nature was amazing. Water has blue tinge and its much better than any Mumbai beach I have visited. People should reduce throwing objects in to the water otherwise nice to see. People at the place were cool and were not troubling.. unplanned visit would be better but planned visit for Couples may not be great here.",RK Beach
Always relaxing and exhilerating Bay of Bengal,RK Beach

Average place,RK Beach
Visited with family probably with great expectations :) it's a decent place with good cleanliness all around..,RK Beach
Walk on the beach,RK Beach
"Now it is very hot here. I went for a walk on Sunday early morning. No traffic at that time. Good 1 hour walk from Gateway Hotel to Park Hotel. It felt earthy to get my feet wet. Great feeling. Just closed my eyes and took a long breath. I also walked in the evening. It is too crowded for me in the evening and too much particles in the air due to heavy traffic. Beach is clean but could improve. Lots of street food but I did not taste any. If you are from US or Europe, you will get sick. It is the water. Just go there and enjoy the sun and the waves.",RK Beach
My favourite place to unwind,RK Beach
"I have been to RK beach ever since I was a kid and every time I go there, I am excited. Even now, I feel like a kid when I see the waves crashing, excited and glad to be there. Its my favourite place to unwind. Whenever I was feeling a bit low, I used to go on a stroll there, all by myself. The sound of waves and the breeze always soothed me. When I was back home last month, I visited RK beach, which was after 7 years. I was glad to find that that place still holds the same magic, making me excited and glad to watch the waves crashing on the shore.

Better to go there when it is still late afternoon. It gets crowded once the sun goes down. Also, go a bit farther from the spot you entered the beach (from the bus stop). You will find that not only the place is less crowded giving you some personal space but also the view is beautiful to behold. If you are lucky enough, you can find some sea shells washed ashore there. I found quite a number of them last time I went there :)",RK Beach
Beach Attraction,RK Beach
"The Rama Krishna Beach or RK Beach as it is popularly known as, is one of the principal attractions in Visakhapatnam, visited by both tourists and locals.An evening stroll along this beach is a beautiful experience.The best part about this beach is the paved pedestrian walkways that it has, making it smooth and accessible to people of all ages. The beach has it all- well maintained parks, excellent museums, and good open air restaurants. Hawkers selling icecreams, corn on the cob and other tasty snacks have set up their stalls along the beach pavments. A visit to the RK Beach is indeed a pleasant experience, and with the added attraction of enjoying the cool sea breeze and watching the rise and fall of the waves!",RK Beach

Cleanliness and Discipline Seems To Be An Issue Here,RK Beach
"This could be one of the beautiful places but lacks discipline by locals and tourists both. I visited early morning. There were a number of stray dogs in the park. A man in police uniform was peeing just a little away from the beach without bothering about the people who have come to visit the beach. Overall, it seeks a lot of improvement and respect.",RK Beach
One of the best beaches in vizag.,RK Beach

Well maintained and nicely beautified by the munivcipal corporation. good place to jog and while away.,RK Beach
adorable beach,RK Beach
"It is definitely one of the best beaches in India. The panoramic view of the beach from Kailasagiri is awesome. But, one has to be extremely careful while venturing into the waters as this beach is really dangerous due to the presence of rocks in the coast very close to coastal line. The number of cases of drowning of the adventurous kids is very high here. If you are careful, you will enjoy. It is well maintained and the travel y the coastal road up to Bhimili is really enjoyable. you can switch of the a/c in your vehicle and feel the pleasant sea breeze.",RK Beach
Who says you cannot fall in love with beaches again,RK Beach
The hot weather and humidity at Vizag making us sweat decided to bit the beach.. and the lovely place is thronged with people.. it's a lovely place with great snack options.. fine dine Resturant opposite to the beaches.. great place to get you feet wet and feel the cool breeze... Also few temple on main road make.it more happening and apart from beaches you can take a stroll to find other interesting places..,RK Beach

Jewel of Vizag,RK Beach
"Considered as the Jewel of Vizag, the main beach on the beach road. Beautiful beach road with local snacks and main attraction of Vizag. Walking path similar to Mumbai's Marrine drive...This is Vizag's Marine drive. This beach road is from RK beach to Rishikonda beach which is around 11 km",RK Beach
Relax on the seaface esp in the evening,RK Beach
"I guess this is the sea face where almost entire Vizag comes to relax in the evening. Nice wide footpaths with Street food vendors strewn around at regular intervals. The cool sea breeze blows across your hair and one can relax while walking along the long seaface.
I tried the Muri mixture from a Street food vendor. Something similar to what we call Bhel in Mumbai. Everything is mixed with bare hands which was kind of gross. I dint like the taste even.

the beach to be on.,RK Beach

Two sections exist, one at the beginning of the beach road ( behind the parking) where the crowds gather and the one after the submarine museum which is less crowded but has almost no eating places or shacks of any kind (probably because the water in high tide comes almost upto the road.
the slope in the first is more gradual and in the second one steep.Do not however go too deep anywhere as there are no lifeguards or any infrastructure to rescue anyone swept away.
However if you are careful its a lovely beach to enjoy.
Due to the long coastline sunrise and sunset are awesome here.",RK Beach

Very good - but not for bathing,RK Beach
"It is a good beach in a different angle- not for the common bathing/swimming angle. This beach is at the heart of Vizag city, very easily assessable, a long one [ more than a km] and hence no crowd at one place, has an excellent beach road with beautifications and eateries throughout. This beach is to hang around and enjoy the sea. Its not that people do not bath- but most beaches in Vizag are not totally safe for bathing due to the rocks and nature of beach. But it does not matter . The beach road is so beautiful that you will love to have a walk on the pavement also. There are continuous improvements from the government both in the cleanliness and facility angle. There are ample car parking space throughout. If you are lucky enough, you may be able to see/participate in some events/festivals that keep on happening on the beach [ eg. kite flying, beach volleyball , album release, music playing etc. ] You may be even lucky enough to see some film or serial shooting taking place at beach or beach road. In early morning you may see people skating and cycling and its a no car zone. For tourists added advantage is the other attractions on/adjoining/walking distance of the beach- beach road kali temple , Ramakrishna mission, VUDA park and of course Submarine Museum. From the beach when you look at the sea you can see number of ships waiting to get entry at the Vizag port.",RK Beach

Beach Time!,RK Beach
"Its a very popular beach with lot of tourists visiting the place. It is very crowded almost through out the day. Not sure, this was because we went the year end, which is the main tourist season.

Perfect for Long walks!!,RK Beach
A little crowded but very long and well connected. Snacks available. Great for entire family outing......'THE' place 2 hangout in visakhapatnam.,RK Beach
Dirty overcrowded beach,RK Beach
"RK beach as Ramakrishna Beach is popularly called is extremely popular with tourists due to its central location, ease of access and availability of street food counters near the shore.

However, it is extremely dirty with litter, diapers, sanitary stuff, plastics, wrappers thrown all over the place.

In fact, there is something that only the locals know of... And i.e. 3 huge underground drains with dirty water open into the sea usually where people/ tourists take bath. In case, one is not aware, one may end up taking a bath in the dirty water.

One great thing about this beach is the promenade where you can take a leisurely stroll in the evenings and buy some lip-smacking local street food.",RK Beach
very beatiful Sunrise,RK Beach
"Straight long beach within the city. Road beside the beach is very clean. But beach itself is not so clean. During early morning, no vehicle is allowed on the beach side road and lots of people use it for morning workout. we had a sea bath in the morning.

At evening beach is full of temporary shops where you can spend time.",RK Beach

Excellent beach in the city centre,RK Beach

Overall we had a great time in these beaches.....",RK Beach
Good place to walk - especially early in the morning,RK Beach

In the evening, plenty of people walking on the wide footpaths (about 10-12 feet wide). And a bhelwala, kulfi cart every few meters. And women roasting corn (makai) with lemon and spice are present all along, tempting you with the tasty snack. Also saw a few handcarts selling Chinese and other dishes.",RK Beach
Excellent Recreation,RK Beach
It is a very beautiful township beach of Eastern India. The credit for its beautiness totally goes to VUDA. Also the peoples of Vizag have an awareness of neat and cleanness.

A clean beach for a pleasant walk!,RK Beach
"Its about 4 kms from the city center and there are many buses from the RTC bus complex to the beach. Its a clean beach. Due to the high currents in east coast, Swimming is prohibited , still you can take a dip ! :) This is one of the unexplored tourist destinations and visit this place before it gets thronged by tourists. I see a very high possibility for Vizag to become a Beach destination next to Goa (I personally prefer the former :P ) ! If you're an early riser , Do not miss the sunrise. The clouds are generally clear . Its a great place to walk with foot path provided . The food was not very good compared to other beach food like Goa , Mumbai , but there is still room for improvement. I really loved the place. Will come back for sure. Its a little crowded on weekend evenings. Its perfect for early morning visit.",RK Beach

Very well maintained and nice place to spend. Very good scenery. You will feel how the movie being shot. Very clean and best place for family and couples. Entry fees is reasonable rather cheap. Hill top view of sea is the best. One of the best place to visit in Vizag,Ramanaidu Studio
Awesome place. The drive as awesome. View is spectacular. Bean board Cafe is a must visit. If u just want to visit Bean board then do not take ticket at the gate. Tell security you just want to visit bean board. Good parking space available on top too.,Ramanaidu Studio
Awasome place to visit in Vishakhapatnam is this film studio. A lot of movies were shoot here. It's situated a higher altitude than the actual sea level. Here you can spend a lot of time without feeling bored. The scenario of this place is mind blowing. Specially the view of the sea from here is just unbelievable.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Peaceful, the view is of an amazing ocean, town roads greenery... The visit was worthy. Small film studio. It has beautiful houses, photogallery and a cinema museum. Raasta aur manzil dono hi behtar h. Must visit",Ramanaidu Studio
The view was soo perfect but as it is Sunday today it's too rush and you probably have to wait for 20mins to find a place and then 20 mins to order and then like 30mins to get your order. The ambience and food is great & try visiting early Ã¯Â¿Â½,Ramanaidu Studio
Rama Naidu studios is situated on a hill top so the views from up there are so mesmerizing and beautiful .... The whole sea shore is visible and city too. There were mostly the film sets and not actual buildings and some shops also to have Ã¯Â¿Â½,Ramanaidu Studio
The film city is situated between the Ramkrishna Beach and Rishikonda Beach. A bit away from the main Visakhapatnam City. It is situated on the hill which is almoat 2km climb from the sea level. Ã¯Â¿Â½,Ramanaidu Studio

It is like okay. I mean i personally did not found it as such exciting. Not at all maintained. But yes on a random day for outing you can go. The ticket costs 60 per adult and honestly it is more like itne mai itna hi milega types. You can click few pictures here ofcourse. So yea maybe add some good photos to Instagram Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿,Ramanaidu Studio

"I didn't expect this place to be like this, I had a different image of the place in my head and when I visited it did cross my expectations, it's a beautiful place. Lots of different spots to click good pictures and hang around. It's a great place  for a day outing",Ramanaidu Studio

"Ramanaidu studios is a big entity may be in Hyderabad, but again the one in Vizag is a very small one, i believe it was built for names sake. Nothing much happening quite here, just for a feel may be one can visit the location",Ramanaidu Studio
Not a worth place to visit as a tourist. It looks like a deserted place for shooting for films.,Ramanaidu Studio
Very nice studio for photo shoot and all also you can see gopala gopala bike on museum..Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿,Ramanaidu Studio

"It's great shooting spot for Movies and television shows in Vizag , South India. It's also a tourist spot and you will pay for you vehicles and the charge will be varied for vehicles.",Ramanaidu Studio
Nice place it was ... wonderful experience to watch the studio...there are many more antique camera.... video graphy equipment...there is also a jail present for shooting...aa huge palace is also there ....food stall also available but it is costly for normal people... weather is too good. ...park inside... roads are good condition,Ramanaidu Studio
"Established in 2007, Ramanaidu Film Studio in Timmapuram, almost 30-35KM from city. Very few movies directed here. Song from Prabhas movie BILLA was shot in this studio. Not properly maintained . Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
"Spectacular views from the hill top. Entry is Rs.60 per adult. They have setups of Hospital, Jail, Shops etc.. Also have an art gallery of the artists. But washrooms are not maintained properly.",Ramanaidu Studio
A must visit for the fantastic view of the ocean. While the studio has many film set to offer for me the key driver has been the panoramic view of the ocean and the crisscross road through which you reach the spot,Ramanaidu Studio
"The journey to this place was satisfying with the cool breeze of the sea throughout the way.
The equipments used for the shoot were all secured and showcased for the visitors.",Ramanaidu Studio

Just for timepass.
Gives deep knowledge of movie shooting.",Ramanaidu Studio

"One of the best views after Kailashgiri!! Good place to visit!!  Views are spectacular!! Mana Vizag, Dr Ramanaidu garu studios!!",Ramanaidu Studio

"Very small and nothing there  to explore
But veiw and scenery from the place is nice",Ramanaidu Studio
Boring place. Dead studio. No maintenance. Just a waste of time and money. Would not recommend this to anyone. Although I saw loads of tourist coming here in big buses. Entry charge is 50 per adult. Use the 50 bucks to eat an ice cream instead while sitting on the beach. Do not go!,Ramanaidu Studio
A place where you can have fun in different demo movie set. The whole area is very decorated and clean. but the it can be more informative.,Ramanaidu Studio

Not recommend. It's not historical place so they should repair or reconstruct. All are damaged areas. Entry cost also high. Nothing to see there just normal buildings with damages.,Ramanaidu Studio
There is nothing much to see. Old buildings and not maintained well. Entry ticket is 50RS per person and not worth it. As it is on the hill it has great view point.,Ramanaidu Studio
"The scenic beauty of city is much more joy to the eyes from the hill top, towards the sea view as well as the IT SEZ SIDE. However, the film studio is not being maintained.",Ramanaidu Studio

Don't go.. nothing is there to see.  They r charging unnecessarily from people...,Ramanaidu Studio
Good place....Art gallery is very strong....know about history of Indian cinema.....view point is beautiful...Only 1/2 Tiffin place...some shooting place is very poor condition....,Ramanaidu Studio
A medium sized studio.Enjoy the zig-zag road to the studio. Nice place for family outing.,Ramanaidu Studio
I stayed 18 days in Visakhapatnam. Really this is a good place sure I will visit more time  in this place.,Ramanaidu Studio
Nice place to vizit.We can spend some time there. But due to lack of shooting it was not much interested. If shootings starts it will be more attractive.Views from the top are amazing. A visit on a sunny day is recommended.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Please pay attention to what I say before visiting the place.
The place in which the studio is located is nice but there is something mysterious about the place. When I visited the place, I felt something was wrong with Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
A great film city owned by the family of Rana Daggubati. Great view of the city from the top of the hill.,Ramanaidu Studio
Ok,Ramanaidu Studio
"Ramanaidu studios is awesome film studio in Visakhapatnam, near Rushikonda... we can find the famous police station set... and the big bungalow set and the temple set... the market set and also we can find the museum of cinema room... where Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
"Except the film musium I find nothing interesting about the place ,  one needs to visit this place to have a glance about Indian movie history and  analog Film Technology",Ramanaidu Studio
One time watch.The place is not at all maintained well,Ramanaidu Studio
Happy with family time. Nice place.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Rama Naidu film studio is located on top of hill, the view from here is breathtaking. And the best part is bean board. On of the best cafe in Visakhapatnam. It contains many sets in here",Ramanaidu Studio
"Ideal for a weekend short get out

Cleanliness to be improved . . .",Ramanaidu Studio
"Excellent  film studio

All south movie are here",Ramanaidu Studio
Nice place to visit,Ramanaidu Studio
Cafe is good and nyc spots for photoshoot,Ramanaidu Studio
One can get an idea of how movie are made . Different sets.,Ramanaidu Studio
Just awesome place... Not studio.. just the scenary,Ramanaidu Studio
Nothing much to see inside. Good for a stroll around the park( too costly if we pay 50rs for that). It woild be more exciting of there was a movie shooting or something else happening. It just felt like a cluster of abandoned buildings,Ramanaidu Studio
Most beautiful place good view best hangout,Ramanaidu Studio
"#U will definitely like the scenery or view from there.
#U will find different places for shooting at one place.
#U can see museum, temple, shops, police station etc for shooting. Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
"The place with scenic beauty. Good view of sea and hill roads. The film city under it's own infrastructure has detoriated a lot over couple of years. Lot of damages to the properties not attended to. No repairing no painting. Not recommended, at least not the repeat visit.",Ramanaidu Studio
"Definitely one gets the taste of a Film Studio, yet one   can find a great view of the beach and the whole city altogether. The bustling breeze may make you feel cold, even when the rest of Vizag is considerably warm. Also the wind is so strong that you may loose  control of you mobile phones while clicking pictures. So, be careful.",Ramanaidu Studio
Its a great view point but it is very badly maintained and the entry cost 50/- is totally not worth of it. Day by day this place is becoming couples / lovers spot. A great place for photography. Taking a Camera is beneficial.,Ramanaidu Studio
"There is nothing much to see. Old set-up but not maintained well. Entry ticket of Rs. 50 per head is not worth at all. However, good location for photography as it is on the hill top and has agreat view point. So cool and clean place and so Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
You can have an awesome view of the city from this studio.,Ramanaidu Studio
Superb Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿,Ramanaidu Studio
Awsome place.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Good view and location..
See others photos uploaded here..
But not many sceneries and locations inside.. Small place studio.. Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
This place has good view points but has only few places inside to take good pictures. Price for each person entry is 60rs as of 6th Nov 2021.,Ramanaidu Studio
Nice Good experience,Ramanaidu Studio
"Viewing of sea from top of the hill is really amazing.
The way from main road to studio is maintaining well.
A lot of scope for further development.
Needs some more improvements.",Ramanaidu Studio
U can spend a day... Scenic view is fantastic.. there is a coffee shop..bean board that is awesome...,Ramanaidu Studio
Worst place during our visit...you have to go long...pay for ticket and get nothing interesting to see...i don't understand why it is in tourist attraction list...better to watch a movie in ticket cost,Ramanaidu Studio
"It's amazing view from hilltop on a breezy day, nothing much to see in the studio.only set of a small temple, hospital,shops,one bungalow set are there,that too not so great looking.old movie equipments of Suresh productions are present in Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
Nice place for shooting. It has nice structures which help in creating a good picture. It also has a big shooting studio which can be taken on lease. Anybody can take photos with a bull in the park or in a jail which feels too good.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Situated on top of a hillock on the way to Bhemili road, Rama Naidu Studio is a must visit spot of Vizag.   This place offers beautiful location for movies shooting which offers various beautiful structures and buildings, indoor area, beautiful landscaped gardens and many more.",Ramanaidu Studio
Boring place with no maintenance at all. All houses shops are in worst conditions. The only thing good here is the view from top. It's very far from city so better avoid going there and spend relaxing time on near by rushikonda beach.,Ramanaidu Studio
The most scenic place.The studio itself may not have wow factors about it.But the ocean view is amazing. No transport to reach the hill top.Better travel in own vehicle.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Film set was very descriptive, starting from police station, to Bangalow, to Toilet, to garden, and upto small rooms.",Ramanaidu Studio
"here you can see various film making instruments, posters, images and some places for film shooting.but it need to be more informative and more things to be kept for seeking interest. although the place is clean but it should be more carefully maintained.",Ramanaidu Studio
Studio was asom but ticket counter person is too deley for ticket distbueting,Ramanaidu Studio
"Museum is there where you can find old cameras, light etc. From the museum there is  scenic beauty of sea we can much. Don't expect much",Ramanaidu Studio
If you want to go to the Bean Board you don't have to purchase a n entry ticket for Rama Naidu studios. But while returning you have to show the bill for what you have purchased in the Bean Board,Ramanaidu Studio
Only few sets like jail & two three big buildings & one normal traditional house. It should be developed and maintained. Best beach view from the hill.situated in  Outskirts  of vizag. Beach road.,Ramanaidu Studio
I don't why the reviewers are giving 5 star ratings for this place. Yes the place has nice view of beach and scenic drive but the thing is that it lacks proper maintenance. Everything here is Damaged. No proper Landscaping.  No proper Ã¯Â¿Â½,Ramanaidu Studio
"This place is located on the side road between Vizag. It is a hill top and it is awesome to watch from the studio. From this place you can get very good views of Vizag City, Sea. It has studio rooms, flim making equipment, awards and Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
"Super
But poor area",Ramanaidu Studio
"Location is very good and Scenic sea from hill view.
Best time to visit is evening hours..
Nice cool sea breeze..",Ramanaidu Studio
"Film studio is a good place to visit with friends and family to explore the duplicate  constructions of villas and aesthetic traditional rural village houses and artifical setups of colony comprised of shops and temples.
Preferred for one time visits except celebrity visit for shootings.",Ramanaidu Studio
The location is really cool and the place needs to be managed well.. The entry ticket is only 50rupees for 5+age... The place was well designed but not maintained in the same way.. I wish it will be one of the best visiting places in vizag for wonderful view points from hill side..,Ramanaidu Studio
"Only visited the cafe, not the studio...worth visiting...nice location and ambience",Ramanaidu Studio
"As it is on the hill it has great view point,The studio itself may not have wow factors about it , but for people used to RFC Hyderabad , the place needs to be managed well..",Ramanaidu Studio
Nice place,Ramanaidu Studio
"Location is great, view is great, best Place to spend the time with loved ones.everything is good.I recommend to visit atleast onceÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿",Ramanaidu Studio
"A good view from the hill top and a small park near the entrance are good... Place is not maintained well.. Sets of temple, bungalow and museum are there. There are many places worth spending your time than this",Ramanaidu Studio
A very good place to hang out with friends. Located on top of the hill its a beauty to see. When you go remember to go on bikes to enjoy the air and its beauty. Remember to carry eatables with you.,Ramanaidu Studio
Worst maintenance.. waste of money....,Ramanaidu Studio
"Only one film studio in visakhapatnam, thanks remanaidu and his sons, t visitors are most enjoying spot. especially in beach view and the hill journey also good.",Ramanaidu Studio
"Actually my First experience at film studios and it was crazier. Rich n poor's houses, police station, hill tpp views, jail and lots of more things are there.
Sea site views from here was Superbbb. Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
Superb for studio collections of Camares,Ramanaidu Studio
"Not that good like Ramoji Film City, but it gives a nice view of the sea... Place is good for general photography.... However, camera photography is not allowed inside the studio..... Mobile photography is allowed.",Ramanaidu Studio
Fantastic place. But it will be boring during non-shooting days.,Ramanaidu Studio
Good place to hangout for a while in the evening.,Ramanaidu Studio
"As a Film Studio, compared to Ramoji Film city,  Mumbai film city and , even Noida film city which i visited,  this studio may at the best be, rated 3. But if i look it as a place to hang out, it is rated 5. A great scenic beauty,  Words Ã¯Â¿Â½",Ramanaidu Studio
Not maintained at all and they should close down or hand over to VUDA. May be it has good real estate value for the owners. It is unethical to collect entrance fee from public for seeing the dilapidated buildings and encash the brand name this way. Hope the management take action in the interest of public.,Ramanaidu Studio
Ok but not too goodÃ¯Â¿Â½,Ramanaidu Studio
Awesome view of Sea from here,Ramanaidu Studio
Ramanaidu sir guessed that vizag will develop good and make film city in vizag that too in prime area,Ramanaidu Studio
"The location is price less. But lot needs to be done by management in line of Ramoji studious , Hyderabad to make it a great tourist attraction. It was deserted and appeared management content in increasing property price rather than contribute to the tourism economy of VIZAG",Ramanaidu Studio
"It is only studio in Visakhapatnam & also in Andhra Pradesh dont compare it to Ramoji film city Hyderabad it is one of the biggest studios in Asia,views are best &curves while we drove is really awesome the Beauty of the sea is simply awesome from studio it is a must visit place for everyone.",Ramanaidu Studio
Nice place to visit and take photos and videos. Not So Big as Ramoji Flim City but it is also not less. Many south movies has been shoot here. Near to Rushikonda Beach.,Ramanaidu Studio
Earlier it was quite maintained and beautiful but after the cylone hudhud it lost is attraction....natural views are still very beautiful.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Ramanaidu, a film producer is the owner of the studio. A small studio with few sets are there. For the tourists of Visakhapatnam it is one of the places of attraction. From the top elevation, bay of Bengal is seen along with some hillocks. Nothing special it is, only just addition in the list of spots to Vizag tourists.",Ramanaidu Studio
"A fun place to visit. Especially the view, it's awesome. Go in the evenings and try to go on weekends. It'll mostly be deserted in week days.",Ramanaidu Studio
It is a nice place for Sideview.,Ramanaidu Studio
good place to visit  in vizag with family & friends,Ramanaidu Studio
It's okay but the hill view is the best place in beach road,Ramanaidu Studio
Only few black & white photos of Ramanaidu garu and outdated machinery shifed from Hyd kept as museum. Nothing else is there and waste of money. Building are there in the stage of collapse.,Ramanaidu Studio
No shooting was done here for the last couple of years but still a nice place to visit different sets pretty much ready without renovation,Ramanaidu Studio
"The only film studio in Visakhapatnam. A couple of houses, shops and a temple. Those are the sets for movie shooting. Apart from that, you have two museums - one showing the history of Indian Cinema and the other showing the life history of Dr. Rama Naidu.",Ramanaidu Studio
Disgusting experience..If you like empty buildings this is the place for you. There is only beautiful scenery left. Other than that there is nothing significant worth visiting.,Ramanaidu Studio
On of the best places in Vizag to spend a relaxing evening with good food and a beautiful view. The atmosphere is very relaxing and chill as well!,Ramanaidu Studio
Nice place to visit in winterÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½,Ramanaidu Studio

What has made it more interesting is the Coffee Shop called Bean Board. A must visit for coffee lovers. They have a branch in Siripuram Junction also,Ramanaidu Studio
Its Serene..n if its rainy then it feels heavenly,Ramanaidu Studio
Bean Board offers great view and they have games that you can play. They promote the concept of conversations and hence have no TV screens which is a good concept.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Need to maintain properly, if maintained properly with some additional attractive spot it would be an enjoyable play",Ramanaidu Studio
