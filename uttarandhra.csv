Visited this temple way back in the late 1970s and remember climbing quite a few steps to reach the temple. But now vehicles are allowed right up to the temple.

The deity is supposed to be in the form of a wild boar head, human torso & lion tail but we could not see these features as the idol was covered with Sandal paste giving an appearance of Siva Linga. Understand once in a year one can see the deity on Akshaya Tritiya day with out any sandal paste.

We were lucky to see the temple from Sanctum Sanctorium. One can purchase the ticket for Rs 200. Photography is not permitted inside.

31.0,"This is a must visit temple for the Hindus. It hosts a Veda patashala and sends purohits to temples in various places.

The temple is atop a small hill and can be approached through several routes.

The crowd levels have increase significantly and the temple authorities have introduced a complex queue line system. All the space inside the temple has been taken up by long steel barriers. It is better to avoid weekends if you want to have a peaceful darshan. Elderly people better buy 100 darshan tickets to avoid walking long distance. Authorities should shorten queue system when the crowds are less. We were forced to walk for several hundred metres even there were no people ahead of us. It took us 15 min to reach the last of the piligrims ahead of us. Coconuts and Tulsi malas are not allowed inside the main deity. You will have to submit them to a small idol in the queue system only.

Getting a view of the idol compensates for all the trouble taken. Prasad was distributed on our bare hands though there were leaf cups available in the office. Drinking water system is available but not convenient.

Some piligrims put their arms around a pillar. They believe that if their fingers touch, they are blessed. Now a person asks you to embrace the pillar and ties a rope around for a few seconds and then collects money for that.",Simhachalam Temple

It is an unparalled and uncomparable temple of its kind not only in the North Circars or Uttarandhra, but in the entire Telugu speaking regions. Though every village in the Telugu nadu is hailed at least by a small Rama Mandiram, the next place goes to Narasimha Temples. Most of them are happended to be ancient temples. In seemandhra, in Telangana, in Rayala seema, and even in the farther Southern regions, presence of a number of Narasimha Temples supports this statement

From days unknown till today a good number of functions like the annual, half yearly, quarterly, fortnightly, weekly and daily ritualistic functions are observed in this temple verbatim. The traditions and conventions stay very hard here and are never disturbed either by the day to day increasing flow of the pilgrims or by the local political disturbances.

The temple activities are managed by the Pusapati Gajapatis, for last three centuries.
The architectural of the central shrine follows Kalinga style. Facing towards west, it is a square shrine surmounted by a high tower, a portico in front with a small tower, a carved 16 pillared Natya mantapa. The shrine has inscriptions dating back to 1098 AD on its walls. The deity is always kept covered with sandal paste. The actual form of the deity is in the tribhanga posture with two hands & head of a lion, which can be viewed only during the 'Chandanotsavam' in April/May. Legend has it that the Ugra form of Narasimha as he killed the demon Hiranyakashipu was so fierce that the image is kept covered by sandal paste throughout the year.
Millions of devotees from around the country visit this temple every year especially during the Chandanotsavam Festival Season. On the annual ritual Chandanotsavam day, the Lord is covered with a new fresh layer of Sandalwood.

The temple is open between 5am and 7:30 pm and again for those who have missed the Darshan (view for worship) about 8:30pm. On all days you can worship the God covered in sandal. Thisbis because of his nature that he is being kept cool covered in sandal. Once in a year on Akshaya Tritiya around April the God can be seen in his original avataar called Nija Darshan. It takes about an hour or less on general working days to complete the darshan and see the temple. There are 2 ways to reach the temple atop The hill. A 4 km ride by road on your vehicle or the local busses available or a 1000 step walk taking you direct to the temple in about 40 minutes. Since the day of the God is believed to be Saturday you can expect a handsome crowd than other days. Feel is very good in front of the God.

During our visit on one of the evenings in April, not much crowd was there and Darshan could be had easily. Though the darshan are usually for few moments as the queue needs to move for accommodating more people, the Purohits there do not push or shout at you as can be a scene in many crowded temples in India.

The Deity here is Vishnu and worshipped as Varaha Narasimha. Vishnu is manifested here with a boar head, human torso and a lions tail. Except a single day in an year ie Akshaya tritiya, the idol is covered with a sandalwood paste through out the year and the purpose for that as per legend is to keep the whole city/area cool or away from unusual heat.

The visitors should not only focus to see the main deity but also look around for its exquisite sculpture. One of the most pleasant things I found about the temple was that purhotis (Pandas/priests) had not been forcing anyone to give money and their treatment for giving blessings to every one was totally unbiased apparently, an unusual sight in India.

Once you reach in front of its main gopuram ( the ornate enterance gate) you can buy Prasad ( they also distribute Prasad inside but you can buy from outside if you intend to take more for your friends and family). Buy the tickets ( I think it's special darshanam or something like that) for Rs.100 if you want to avoid an endless long line otherwise the other usual darshan is free. For those with any walking issues, there is a provision of an elevator on the right side of the main enterance which takes you straight to the enterance of main sanctum of the God. Try to follow the line even though many people don't do that once they are inside. If you have elderly or young children, make sure they stick with you because sometimes people pretty much push others around. Just follow the line and you may finally be directed out after seeing the main deity. The narsimha deity is about 2 ft tall and is covered in sandalwood paste.
Overall a very nice experience. Can sit outside and admire the architecture as well as the beauty of the hills around.
The temple remains very neat and clean.
Phones/cameras are not allowed and have to be kept in locker. There is no extra charge for lift use if the liftman feels that you may not be able to climb.( My father in law has a foot amputated so he and my mom in law could use the lift but me and hubby were asked to climb the stairs :) ) You can take water bottle inside. It is advisible to go here in the morning hours before 8-8:30 am to avoid rush. If you plan to have breakfast after darshan, you may have to come back to the city for it.

As per Wikipedia, ‚ÄúThe Shri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Simhachalam is a South Indian Hindu temple situated on the Simhachalam hill, which is 800 metres above the sea level at a distance of ten miles to the north of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It is dedicated to one of the Hindu trinity deities Vishnu, who is worshipped there as Varaha Narasimha. As per the temple's legend (which is divided into 32 chapters), Vishnu manifested in this peculiar form, with a boar head, human torso and a lion's tail, after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter's father Hiranyakashipu.‚Äù

I found Vizag city to be one of the cleanest cities in India. No wonder it got the third rank in Swatch Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign) among all cities of India (top two being Indore and Bhopal). The city spends lot of energy and time to clean the city and manage the greens and the landscapes of the city ‚Äì it was much appreciated.

The temple was atop the hill and the drive was smooth and comfortable. There was fairly large parking for cars and when we went there at around 5pm in the evening, the temple was quite empty. While elaborate arrangements were made for the crowd, we were lucky to find none. There was no entry fee for the temple but it was customary for the worshippers to carry some items like coconut and flowers. Inside the temple, we got our turn after a wait of few minutes. After paying a donation of Rs 500/- with receipt, we participated in elaborate pooja by the priest at the temple.

484.0,Simhachalam Temple ~ Sri Varahalakshmi Narasimha Swamy,Simhachalam Temple
485.0,"Simhachalam temple is a Hindu temple located in Andhra Pradesh, South India, and is dedicated to the incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu known as Narasimha (the man-lion).

Origin of the name SIMHA: Lion, Chala: hill Atop the hill is a famous temple said to be the abode of Narasimha swami, and hence the hill itself is called (nara)simhachalam. The temple is situated in the city of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.

The statue of the deity gives ‚Äúnijaroopa darshan‚Äù (holy appearance in true form) for only 12 hours in a year i.e on Akshaya Tritiya day, the rest of the time the statue is covered with sandalwood paste. The darshan described as chandana yatra or chandanotsavam falls every year in Vaisakha masa (May). The deity at Simhachalam, the lion-man incarnation of Lord Mahavishnu is usually covered with sandalwood paste. The original shape of the deity in the tribhanga posture has two hands with the head of a lion on a human torso. An inscription dated as far back as 1098 AD of the Chola king Kuloththunga provides some clue as to its antiquity. Another inscription shows a Queen of the Eastern Ganga of Kalinga(ancient Orissa) (1137-56 AD) covering the image with gold while a third inscription says the eastern Ganga King of Orissa Narasimha Deva built the main/central shrine in 1267 A.D. With more than 252 inscriptions in Oriya and Telugu describing the antecedents of the temple, it is a historically important monument.

Sri Krishna Deva Raya after defeating the Gajapati ruler of Orissa Gajapati Prataparudra Dev visited the shrine twice in 1516 AD and 1519 AD and offered numerous villages for maintenance of bhogam (worship) along with valuable jewellery of which an emerald necklace is still in the temple. For the last three centuries the Royal family of Vizianagaram,‚Äù The Pusapati Gajapathi‚Äôs‚Äù have been the temple‚Äôstrustees.This temple was build in the style of Orissa temple architecture. Legend Hiranyakasipu was a Rakshasa king. He was in fact one of Vishnu‚Äôs Dwarapalakas or gate keepers in Vaikuntha, Jaya and Vijaya. They had to take birth in the mortal world thrice because of a curse given by Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanathana and Sanathkumara, who were not allowed to take darshan of Mahavishnu by them. The other palaka was born as his brother Hiranyaaksha. Hiranyakasipu wanted to become immortal and hence performed austerities (tapasya) to propitiate Lord Brahma. However, Lord Brahma said that was not possible so Hiranyakasipu asked Lord Brahma to grant him a boon so that he could not be killed by any animal or a man neither in the morning nor in the night, by any weapons, neither in sky nor on the earth.

Hiranyakasipu wanted the entire world to worship him. But, Prahalada, his son, was a devotee of Lord Narayana and always expressed his bhakti towards Him. In spite of warning him several times, Hiranyakasipu could not alter Prahlada‚Äôs devotion. This made Hiranyakasipu angry and he made numerous attempts to get Prahlada killed. One of them was to throw him off the top of a mountain. However, Vishnu rescued him by moving the mountain and made a small path for Prahaladha. It is said that in the place where the Lord stood to protect Prahaladha is the place where the temple is built.",Simhachalam Temple

673.0,"Simhachalam Temple is located in the beautiful city of Visakhapatnam on a hill.The true meaning of Simhachalam is that Simha meaning Lion and Achala means A Hill.

Lord Narasimha, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu is the main deity of this temple. The Legend say that Lord Vishnu took this incarnation to demolish and kill the Asura Hiranyakashyap, the father of Prahlad.

Prahlad was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu and the demon Hiranyakashyp was a dead enemy of Lord Vishnu. He had attained a boon from Brahma that he should not be killed by a Man or an animal, neither in the day nor in the night..Vexed with his son's preachings, he tries to kill his son by giving poison, throwing from a top of the hill, through elephants but alas he survives because of the Grace of Lord Vishnu.

Prahlad says that Lord Vishnu is everywhere. So the Demon asks whether your Lord Vishnu is in the Pillar by hitting the Pillar. Then the Pillar breaks then, a Half Lion and a half man comes out which is none other than Lord Narasimha. He kills the Asura and crowns Prahlad as the King.

The deity, at this temple, is usually covered with sandalwood paste year round and can be seen without sandalwood ie ""Nijaroopa Darshan"" for only 12 hours per year. On Akshaya Tritiya Day,of Vaisakha, which generally falls in the month of May every year. Then the deity is re-covered with sandalwood paste.

Private cars can go upto the hill and there is vast place for parking of vehicles. There is Quick entry darshan for Rs. 20/- and special darshan for Rs.100. Inside the temple, archana tickets are sold at Rs. 200 ( two persons are allowed) where one can enter the sanctum and see the God from very close.

There is a special pillar inside the temple called ""Srivari Kappasthambam"". At the bottom of this holy pillar is the sculpture of Santhana Gopalaswamy, carved.

Background?

Simhadri or Simhachalam is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Narasimha (the man-lion), an incarnation (avatar) of Lord Vishnu. ""Simha"" in Sanskrit means lion; ""Adri"" or ""Achala"" in Sanskrit means hill. The temple is located at the top of a hill; hence the temple is called Simhachalam. The deity is usually covered with sandalwood paste year round and can be seen without sandalwood (""nijaroopa darshan"" ‚Äì holy appearance in true form) for only 12 hours per year. On Akshaya Tritiya Day, the deity is re-covered with sandalwood paste.",Simhachalam Temple

My visit to the temple was not as a tourist. Though I have spent 4 years in Visakhapatnam I visited the temple only once as one of friend stayed very close to it. The visit to the temple is no different than any other Hindu temple. Language of money is prevalent here and if you can splash a couple of hundreds you are treated like a VIP. While I am not an atheist but the way management committees handle the temple affairs across the country it literally pisses me off.

1311.0,"The Hill is a wonder in itself. The presiding deity is Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy, clad in loads of Chandan all the year throughout, but for a single day i.e. Akshaya Trutiya day in the Visakha masa. The Nija Rupa of the deity can be seen on that particular day only. The deity is a manifestation of Lord Vishnu in two Avatars - Varaha & Nrusimha. Though the exact age of the temple & shrine remain yet to established with authenticity, inscriptions & Archaeological evidences suggest almost a 1000 years history.

The temple is adorned with rich architecture and has been the recipient of patronage from all the Rulers of this region. It is well accessible from almost any part of Visakhapatnam. If time permits, one can venture around to visit the natural springs on the hill and have a shower underneath them too. One of such spring can be found on the Stairway.

Trekking up the (around 1100 steps) stairway is indeed a good way to reach the temple. There is a fantastic ghat road, about 5 km long, to reach the temple. Buses of APSRTC ply from few locations (Dwaraka Bus Station Complex, both gates of Visakhapatnam Railway Station, RK Beach etc,) directly to the hill top and the foothill as well. The Devasthanam also plies regular shuttle buses from the Hilltop and back.

In case, you use personal private conveyance to reach the hilltop, do make sure that you stopover at least at a couple of places, while returning and spend few minutes for yourself. The views are simply amazing & you would not forget them for a long time. But a word of caution:: the ghat road winds through a forest famous for deadly snakes & leopards.

The shrine is usually crowded during the mornings on Saturday & Sunday & also on Ekadasi day. A must see during your trip to Vizag.",Simhachalam Temple

The image of the Lord resembled a Shivlinga covered with sandal paste . We were told that the idol represented the fierce form of Narsimha when he killed Hiranyakashyapu and hence it is kept cool under the sandal wrappers through out the year , except on Akshay Trutiya when the layers were removed and the brave devotees could pay their obedience .

Sheshashayee Vishnu with his Lakshmi was shown on Viman Gopur . For the second time we saw Lord Vishnu sitting on the throne made by Shesha . The first occasion was at Sree Ananth Padmanabhaswamy Temple at Ananthapura in Kasargod District , Kerala . Narsimha was depicted in several forms . In one He was shown tearing the stomach of Hiranyakashyapu placing him on his bent right thigh . In other He placed him , holding a dagger in his right hand ,across his two legs to dispatch him to Yamlok .

Lord Vishnu was aesthetically and beautifully depicted in His Dashavaatars . Intricate stone carvings were abundant on the outer walls of the temple . In one such carving of Kalpwruksha , Lord Buddha was shown meditating .

But alas , one of the most beautiful temples was deprived of its rich heritage by hiding the unparaller art behind the covers .",Simhachalam Temple

There are three entrances, Rs. 100, Rs. 20 and free entrance. All the entrances will take you only up to a point from where the group gets mixed and move towards the deity. If you want to cut short your time, Rs. 20 line is ideal.

Avoid buying Tulsi or any garlands from vendors who will pester you in queue. The temple priests will not accept it and so you will have to be satisfied in garlanding statues in periphery yourselves.

1552.0,Simhadri Lord Narasimha,Simhachalam Temple
1553.0,"Simhachalam (‚ÄòSimha‚Äô means lion ‚ÄòChalam‚Äô means hill), at about 800 feet about the sea level, is part of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. On the hill top the temple of Lord Narasimha, the (man-lion) incarnation of Lord Vishnu, is situated. It is said to be the best sculptured shrine in Visakhapatnam. Because of the temple of Lord Narasimha the hill is named Simhachalam, Simhadri, and Narasimha and so on. At the foot of the hill for about ten miles of the road from Visakhapatnam, is a rose-garden said to have been planted by the well known legendary hero Sitarama Raju and now maintained by the authorities.

The path way up to the temple runs from near the rose garden, through terraced fields of pineapples, dotted with mango, jack and other trees.

While you journey through the stone steps which are more than thousand laid between the green trees on either side, I felt that I was walking under ‚Äòsandi thadak‚Äô in Mysore gardens. On reaching Hanuman gate I saw the waterway flowing down into two pools where pilgrims bathe before they continue the journey. After passing all the way there are several sculptures of the gods and then reach the temple. Whoever does this exercise to reach the abode of Lord Narasimha will be thrilled and curiosity multiplied to see the God as soon as possible for having taken so much of trouble and pain.

On entering the main temple I saw a pillar called Kappastambham (‚Äòkappam‚Äô means kanike or offering ‚Äòsthambam‚Äô is the pillar). At the foot of this pillar I saw an image of Lord Krishna called Santhana Gopala Swamy. It is popularly and firmly believed by the devotees that the childless couples were to embrace this pillar; they will be blessed with child soon. It is attributed that this pillar has immense powers of curing cattle-disease. It is also believe by hugging this pillar the devotee‚Äôs desires will be fulfilled by Lord. The temple is of more than thousand years.

The most peculiar feature of this temple is the main deity is kept covered with sandal paste. It is installed in the middle of the stone car with stone wheels and prancing stone horses. The image of the god seems to be small in size. The tradition is that once is a year, particularly in May on Chandanayatra festival the paste will be removed ceremoniously.

The Kalyanotsava of Lord with His consort goddess Laxmi will be celebrated on the beautifully decorated Natyamandapam on the north side of the temple. You can count 96 pillars of black stone, arranged in sixteen rows of six each, to support this Mandapam. The speciality of the carving on these pillars is that one is not similar to other. All are different in the details of their design. The lotus above these pillars is similarly in inverted shape. You must have sufficient time to enjoy these scenes in this temple. Don‚Äôt be in a hurry when you go there.

The important functions and festivals, as noted on the notice board, are Telugu New Year Ugadi, Car festival, annual Kalyanotsavam (Wedding of the Lord) and the most important is Nijaroopa darsanam of the idol of Lord Narasimha. This is during April/May depending upon Telugu panchangam. On this day the idol will be exposed in its true colour to the devotees, hence it is named as Nijaroopa darsanam. Lakhs of devotees gather here on that day to take the darshan of Lord Narasimha in His real features. There are other festivals throughout the year.
The Giri pradakshina is observed on Ashada poornima.

Temple is open from 7am to 4pm and again from 6pm to 9pm. There is a Free Dormitory facility for the pilgrims. There are several Guest Houses and cottages on Uphill. There are private and RTC bus facilities from Visakhapatnam to Simhachalam (20 km). Rail station is at Waltair Railway Station.",Simhachalam Temple

It was built on top of a huge range of hills, way back 1000's of years ago and located near by Gopalapatnam, Visakapatnam.

You can go for Darshan for free or by paying a Rs.100 for Darshan. Which takes less time. After Darshan, make sure to have Laddo and Puliharam (The yellow rice) as prasadam, which is sold at a huge outlet out side the temple premises. I am sure you will love the Puliharam. You can easily reach here from any part of the city using APSRTC Buses.

If you intend to visit this temple and want to stay for a day in an hotel, please look for an hotel in city, as the hotels near by temple area arent upto the mark.

,"Central, dirty and lively",RK Beach
,"This is the main and most central beach in Vizag, sandy and long with very scenic rocks and a good views of the city's seafront, from the port with its huge cranes to the south to the hills and promontories to the north.
There are plenty of statues, colourful murals, stalls selling souvenirs and snacks and the area really comes alive in the evening when locals come here to enjoy the breeze, socialize, eat and be merry.
Unfortunately the beach is very dirty and at times very smelly (sewer water?) so I think the best option is to walk along Beach Road and enjoy the view from a distance rather the go on the beach itself.
As it is customary on most Indian beaches, no swimsuits, no swimming, no water sports (though if you wear a t-shirt a dip in the sea is OK)",RK Beach

With day-trip and excursion groups visiting in large buses, loads of cars, bikes and all that. This slightly reduces the natural charm, if you are looking for some peace and solace. For family and friend time, this could be a good place. With loads of fun activities and eating options all around.

There is park, ropeway, a big Lord Shiva statue and one can have a beautiful view of whole Vishakapatam from this place. And again in the evening one can go to RK beach and join the crowd there.

,Good Experience,RK Beach
,"The R.K.Beach is the most popular beach among the lot. The issue is though that the beach road that goes by the RK Beach has only a a handfull of hotels.
Most of the buildings are residential complexes. So the charm and beauty of having a beach view room is a bit difficult coz of the lack of options.

The beach itself is very clean. The road by the beach has very wide and well maintained footpaths for people to walk and jog.
The roads are closed for vehicle till 76.30am as people walk and jog. Even I took part during my stay.
Quite a few restaurants are available and swiggy and zomato is available in plenty in the nearby hotels.",RK Beach

From safety point of view, there are multiple rocks on the beach which makes swimming risky..at the same time the sand keeps on slipping underneath and so one, especially children and women, should be careful, while swimming

Rama Krishna (R K) Beach is full of crowd and one would never feel lonely there. There are also multiple hotel options, cheap and costly both, in very close proximity.

Pros
Good view of the sea
Relaxing in nature and a popular hangout place
Good connectivity with city bus, ola and uber
Tourist attractions like Submarine museum, aircraft museum, fish museum (Matsyadarshini), Kali temple, Doll museum in walking distance
Multiple restaurants nearby

Cons
No sitting option
Very limited food options at the beach
Beach with rocks
Needs regular cleanliness and maintenance",RK Beach

,Very disappointed with the upkeep of the beach,RK Beach
,"We were excited to see the Rama Krishna beach after a gap of 15 years but were truly disappointed to see how badly it is maintained by both the residents and the local authorities. It is sad to see such a magnificent beach being destroyed by people who throw litter where ever they feel like all along the beach.

What is even more shocking is the open defecation that the men folk indulge in. It is so sad to see this happen even after our Central and State Govts plead for 'Swach Bharat"" almost every day :-( -:(.

The only solace was that we could enjoy the morning walk along the footpath of the Rama Krishna Beach but we were just heartbroken to see the beach in such a sad condition. We did manage to walk on the beach alongside the magnificent waves but I don't think we will be motivated to visit this beach again unless it is properly maintained!

Cheers",RK Beach

It was a pleasure being there to breathe fresh air before starting your day for official activities.",RK Beach

,Dirty RK Beach in contrast to a Clean Vizag City,RK Beach
,"Any visit to Vizag was incomplete without a trip to the main beach of the city ‚Äì the Ramakrishna (RK) beach. The RK beach adjoins the Beach Road and hosts popular hotels like the The Park and Novotel ‚Äì it also has the famous Submarine museum INS Kursura. Alongside the beach road, there are numerous hotels, restaurants and attractions including an aero plane museum.

After a visit to the submarine museum, at around 5 pm, we headed for the beach. Footpaths were neat and clear and air was rather free from pollution. However, to our dismay, we found the beach to be quite dirty. Apparently, a major festival had ended just a few days back between Christmas and new year ‚Äì and I was told that it was a major festival at Vizag. Post the event, it seemed as if the beach was left dirty.

The banks of the beach were not well maintained without any landscaping. There were spots in the beach that were markedly dirty with pools of filth.

And if this was not enough, there were beach scooters ferrying passengers for a joy ride ‚Äì leaving the sand even filthier.

The current of the water was very strong with rocky waves and I barely entered the water. Nonetheless, my family ventured into the water holding some bamboo poles that were seen at some places.

There were street food vendors selling various stuff on the foot path and on the beach. My family feasted on the stuff much to my chagrin.

Overall, we found it to be a very ordinary beach ‚Äì dirty and unkempt ‚Äì much in contrast to the relatively clean city of Vizag. I request the administration to take note and provide tourist delight through better maintenance. It would be better to have a lazy walk on on the footpath on beach road and do some window shopping or some late night dinner at one of the restaurants.",RK Beach

Just closed my eyes and took a long breath. I also walked in the evening. It is too crowded for me in the evening and too much particles in the air due to heavy traffic. Beach is clean but could improve. Lots of street food but I did not taste any. If you are from US or Europe, you will get sick. It is the water. Just go there and enjoy the sun and the waves.",RK Beach
,My favourite place to unwind,RK Beach
,"I have been to RK beach ever since I was a kid and every time I go there, I am excited. Even now, I feel like a kid when I see the waves crashing, excited and glad to be there. Its my favourite place to unwind. Whenever I was feeling a bit low, I used to go on a stroll there, all by myself. The sound of waves and the breeze always soothed me. When I was back home last month, I visited RK beach, which was after 7 years. I was glad to find that that place still holds the same magic, making me excited and glad to watch the waves crashing on the shore.

Better to go there when it is still late afternoon. It gets crowded once the sun goes down. Also, go a bit farther from the spot you entered the beach (from the bus stop). You will find that not only the place is less crowded giving you some personal space but also the view is beautiful to behold. If you are lucky enough, you can find some sea shells washed ashore there. I found quite a number of them last time I went there :)",RK Beach

I tried the Muri mixture from a Street food vendor. Something similar to what we call Bhel in Mumbai. Everything is mixed with bare hands which was kind of gross. I dint like the taste even.
I guess this place is best to have a long evening walk. Healthier and cleaner eating options are found across the Beach and the Street food vendors can be avoided.",RK Beach

Two sections exist, one at the beginning of the beach road ( behind the parking) where the crowds gather and the one after the submarine museum which is less crowded but has almost no eating places or shacks of any kind (probably because the water in high tide comes almost upto the road.
the slope in the first is more gradual and in the second one steep.Do not however go too deep anywhere as there are no lifeguards or any infrastructure to rescue anyone swept away.
However if you are careful its a lovely beach to enjoy.

,"It is a good beach in a different angle- not for the common bathing/swimming angle. This beach is at the heart of Vizag city, very easily assessable, a long one [ more than a km] and hence no crowd at one place, has an excellent beach road with beautifications and eateries throughout. This beach is to hang around and enjoy the sea. Its not that people do not bath- but most beaches in Vizag are not totally safe for bathing due to the rocks and nature of beach. But it does not matter . The beach road is so beautiful that you will love to have a walk on the pavement also. There are continuous improvements from the government both in the cleanliness and facility angle. There are ample car parking space throughout. If you are lucky enough, you may be able to see/participate in some events/festivals that keep on happening on the beach [ eg. kite flying, beach volleyball , album release, music playing etc. ] You may be even lucky enough to see some film or serial shooting taking place at beach or beach road. In early morning you may see people skating and cycling and its a no car zone. For tourists added advantage is the other attractions on/adjoining/walking distance of the beach- beach road kali temple , Ramakrishna mission, VUDA park and of course Submarine Museum. From the beach when you look at the sea you can see number of ships waiting to get entry at the Vizag port.",RK Beach

However, it is extremely dirty with litter, diapers, sanitary stuff, plastics, wrappers thrown all over the place.

In fact, there is something that only the locals know of... And i.e. 3 huge underground drains with dirty water open into the sea usually where people/ tourists take bath. In case, one is not aware, one may end up taking a bath in the dirty water.

One great thing about this beach is the promenade where you can take a leisurely stroll in the evenings and buy some lip-smacking local street food.",RK Beach

Due to the high currents in east coast, Swimming is prohibited , still you can take a dip ! :) This is one of the unexplored tourist destinations and visit this place before it gets thronged by tourists.

Right from 5am,when the morning walk brigade come, and vehicles are restricted, till midnight, this place is buzzing with people.But it doesn't get over-crowded, mind you.
There are a number of other tourist points , like the submrine(2-7pm) Aquarium(9am-9pm) , War memorial, Chilcren's Park , Kali-Mandir and numerous eateries on the beach road adjacent to RK beach.
Bathing is done here, should be done with caution, swimming is not advisable here - for that matter on any beach of Vizag, because of sudden slopes and rocks !!
So attractive this is, we stayed at ;Nirala Saikat' a simple hotel, in a small room without attached bath or AC - just to be able to sit in the small balcony and look out at the sea from very close.(There are a few homestays, some of them visible on internet - otherwise the high priced ones like Novotel or ITC Welcomgroup type hotels)hotels)

,Imperfect beach condition is compensated by beautification and development,RK Beach
,"If you are in Visakhapatnam as a tourist, you must have visited the Rama Krishna Beach (R K Beach) more than once! It is the tourist hub of the city ‚Äì no matter whether you want to visit any tourist attraction or wish to have a sumptuous dinner, or just want to enjoy watching the waves in the blue sea ‚Äì you must come to R K Beach every time.

If you are in Vizag (not visiting any attraction outside the city), R K Beach is a must visit destination in the evening. Not only the tourists, you will find plenty of locals flocking into the beach area during evening. There are several small shops/stalls along the beach, which could be the perfect place for your evening snacks.

As a beach, R K Beach won‚Äôt score well. It is not exactly the beach that you would think of when considering a beach vacation. The beach is not even suitable/safe for swimming. The beach is not clean and a bit muddy as well in some parts.

However, the imperfect beach condition has been compensated by proper beautification and development throughout the beach area. The all of the Marine Drive has been nicely developed. The road condition is just perfect. There are several parks and sitting areas developed throughout the beach area. A number of restaurants and shops are there as well.

In the R K Beach area, visit the INS Kurusura Submarine Museum (a must visit), Visakha Museum, Matsya Darrshini (aquarium), VUDA Park, Kali Temple, Victory at Sea (war memorial) etc. If your place of accommodation is not at the Beach Road, you can reach R K Beach from any part of the city by bus, auto rickshaw, or cab. Just for your info ‚Äì the hired cab services like Ola and Uber are available in Visakhapatnam ‚Äì you can use these to visit different tourist attractions in the city and outside.",RK Beach

All the age groups are covered, from morning routines at the yoga village or the Novetal dinner delight. Vuda park houses the best of the recreational acumen for one and all.
Submarine fever to the bright and coloured fish viewing experience the popularly named RK Beach is a delight for kids and elders.

I had been on a vacation to the city, ever morning a walk down the beach made a pleasant start on my bike.

But beware of going into the water. Just a little, letting the waves soak your feet is ok but going deeper in the water is very dangerous. Though warnings are kept, people ignore them. The under currents have taken a few lives, best not to go into the water.",RK Beach
,Right in the city,RK Beach

,Good beach to relax and spend quality time with family,RK Beach
,"Ramakrishna Beach or RK beach as it is popularly known reminded me of Marine drive in Mumbai. It was a beach which was very approachable since it was in the city and where you can sit for hours just doing nothing. On our trip to Vizag, we went to RK Beach twice. We really liked it. It also has the famous Submarine Museum, Kali Temple and Aquarium. We only went to submarine Museum and liked it a lot. There is also a swing park on the beach where kids can have a gala time. There was no entry fee for the park. Enjoy the cool breeze of RK Beach along with roadside sellers selling peanut chaat, ice cream, corns, Bhelpuri etc. MUST VISIT Beach when in Vizag.",RK Beach

Well maintained parks have been developed as tourist attraction. Like any other beach, it is beautiful, nothing much special. However on the other side of the beach- road there are number of tourist attractions such as Aquarium, Kali Temple, Visakha museum etc.
The beach good for swimming, sun bathing etc.",RK Beach
,Heart of Vizag. But not its best beach.,RK Beach
,"Go to this beach for the evening ""experience"". Taking a casual stroll on the promenade, munching on some corn or chaat, and just basking in the whole energy of the crowd - that is what this beach is best for.

Otherwise, it's one of the most messiest beaches I have come across. Not the beach's fault of course but the visitor's. The VUDA has placed dustbins at every nook and cranny and yet people prefer to just throw empty water bottles wherever they want. It's also heavily commercialized so not a place you should go for some reflection or peace. Vizag has lot of other beaches like Rushikonda and Yarada which are a hundreds of times better when compared to this one.

There seems to be a lot of renovation going on along this beach right now so it may look prettier in the future but knowing the crowds, they will spoil it anyway.

Pro tip: This is the best spot to glimpse the Dolphin's Nose in its whole spledour!",RK Beach
,"Great to Walk, Wade a bit .. do NOT attempt Swimming or Even Getting in Waist Deep in the Sea Here",RK Beach

,"The beach is perhaps one of the major tourist attractions of the city. However, there few things that have spoilt the otherwise great beach - Too much of litter, many storm water drains open up to the sea in many stretches across this beach raises a stink and are an eyesore.
Word of caution to people who might want to swim here - Keep off the rocks and do not venture into deep waters, there are rip currents that are extremely dangerous and every year many people lose their lives due to these.
Do not miss out on visiting the Kali Mandir adjoining the beach. This Kali Mandir resembles Dakshineswar Kali Mandir of Kolkata.",RK Beach

Hope to see a much better place after completion of developmental work.
Because of haze all 3 days of our stay could not take good photos. Could not even get a good sunrise shot.",RK Beach

,"At a distance of 602 km from Hyderabad, 355 km from Vijayawada, 168 km from Kakinada, 203 km from Rajahmundry and 444 km from Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatnam (also called Vizag) is a coastal & port city in the state of Andhra Pradesh, located on the shores of Bay of Bengal. It is the headquarters of Visakhapatnam district and is also base for Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy.

The city of Vizag, as Visakhapatnam is popularly called, derives its name from the Hindu God of valour, Visakha. The city is located beautifully among the hills of the Eastern Ghats with facing towards the Bay of Bengal. According to the Archaeological records, Visakhapatnam was built by Kulotunga Chola between the 11th and 12th centuries AD.",RK Beach
,small yet beautiful,RK Beach

,Great beach,RK Beach
,"Less hyped than Rushikonda, but I felt it was the best in Vizag. Much less people, less congested, less shops. Located near the Sub museum, you get a great view of the coastline. Sunrise, sunset and the view on a Poornima night are stupendous. Easy to take a short swim in low tide.",RK Beach

,Well maintained beach,RK Beach
,This is a good beach for an evening outing. The sea is shallow and people can be seen sea bathing.

,"R.K. Beach is nothing great when compared to beaches of Goa. However, it is certainly better than Mumbai beaches. It is neat and clean with great crowd. Walking around the beach leisurely in free evenings is a great feeling. You see kids making small huts and drawings on the mud. Across the road you find majestic hotels and residential buildings which look great in dark. Apart from the regular beach snacks, you get to taste some local snacks which are so different than that you find on other beaches. People flock the beach with family and friends on weekends in large numbers and spend time till late evening there. Overall a good place to spend few good hours in the evening.",RK Beach

,"Do not expect anything great from this beach if you are looking for a patch of clean sand near the sea to relax and enjoy nature. All the dirty stinking drains of the city pours its filth in the sea in this patch. As it is right in the middle of city, it is very crowded and you have to sit close to strangers. Plastic bags and pouches, street dogs are another menace.It is better to little further and sit after Tenneti park.",RK Beach

Half a km later a sculptured mermaid and a pair of prehistoric monsters from Jurassic Park amused us . As my native place is Pandharpur ‚Äì seat of Lord Panduranga ‚Äì we did not miss the chance to pay our respects to Lord Panduranga at his temple a few hundred meters up from the beach on a hill and to enjoy the beautiful beach from a vintage point .

We then visited INS Kursura , Asia‚Äôs only submarine museum which I have reviewed already . Our last stop on the beach was the large , shady VUDA Park where we enjoyed the playing kids and flying birds .",RK Beach

,The drains make it look dirty,RK Beach
,"The beach is so close to city and most of the hotels, yet because of the various drains on it I would rate it as average.

,Heart of the City,RK Beach
,"RK Beach is right in the heart of the city and it‚Äôs named after the Ramakrishna Temple. All along the opposite side of the beach are palatial houses, food joints and few religious establishments as well. I used to stay right opposite to the Palm Beach Hotel and hence had a magnificent view of the sprawling beach day in and out.

The municipal corporation ensured that the beach road was kept clean and hence it was quite a sight to see the cleaners at work right from 4 in the morning. The beach was well maintained for the 4 full years when Vizag was my home. However when I recently visited the city I was shocked to see the number of people thronging the beach. It is getting filthier by the day and the management seriously needs to do something about it.

Vizag certainly has plenty of other beaches where one can swim and this certainly is not the one for recreation.",RK Beach
,Okay-okay beach,RK Beach
,"The beach is quite crowded during the early daytime, the beach offers a nice view of the sea but is not quite safe to venture in for a close look. The beach is rocky and is not quite clean but still it is worth a visit as it is located on the prime Beach Road.",RK Beach
,A memorable sea beauty,RK Beach
,"A great scenic beach! The curvature is really interesting. You can see the semi-circular edge line clearly! The coconut-water at the beach add up to the flavour of the beautiful sea-waves! Never miss it! However, avoid buying stationary from here - they are overpriced at the RK Beach!
Do take some memorable shots! I can specially suggest to the photography lovers to take a wide-angle panorama shot with 5 frames horizontally! And it is gonna be a big hit if u manage to take the shot at dusk time!",RK Beach

,Similar to Marine Drive of Mumbai,RK Beach
,"Recently visited RK Beach (known as Rk only) and found it similar to marine drive. For those who don't know about marine drive, I would say a perfect place to go for an evening walk or spend time at night with well lit beach road, ocean breeze and the noise of tides. RK beach area also has good restaurants and one can surely enjoy beach side dinner. One thing to appreciate about the place is that it was clean with cleaning staff working till late. So, please don't litter when you visit. So if you plan to go, take a walk and enjoy the ice-cream too!!!",RK Beach

,Suffering Massive Erosion,RK Beach
,"This is Vizag's promenade. It might as well be disappearing soon. Massive erosion over the past decade had already left the beach shrinking. Certain patches of it (some at an alarming sudden spurt) has eroded even further since the dreaded Hudhud cyclone in October 2014.

The place is packed every evening and even more so on Sundays. Families, youngsters, old people gather around the entire length of the pedestrian way and spill over to the roads on both sides.

For those with expensive taste visitors can find their way to Novotel Hotel or the Taj or The Park. For the regular tourists there are numerous fast food push-carts and economy cafes all along the road. You can pick red cart chinese food, the Andra variety of fritters (bhajiyas) and puffed rice (bhel puris), Aloo Tikkas (potato cutlets) and other local savories. A nice place to have a cuppa is The Chocolate Room. The food is affordable and good.

For visitors, there is the aquarium just below The Chocolate Room and the Kursura Submarine Museum. Mostly, it is simply a crowded promenade. For those with religious leanings, there is a much-visited and revered Kali Mandir.

If you are lucky, you may witness a wedding (seasonal) procession that is really loud and heavily done up with all pomp and show. The beach also hosts Exhibitions and Fairs at regular intervals as well as cultural programs.

Take your pick and enjoy the quaint chaos.",RK Beach

,Rama Krishna Beach - the Exciting Sea Face of Visakhapatnam Smart City,RK Beach
,"Well, Laxmi and I happened to recently visit Visakhapatnam City - that has been specially chosen by the current Union Government as one of the three locations to be upgraded to ""SMART CITY"" Status for the first time in India - the other two locations being Allahabad in the state of Uttar Pradesh and Ajmer in the state of Rajasthan - the latter two located in the northern part of India.

Visakhapatnam is one of the fastest developing cities in the country. Located on the East Coast, it has been principally a Port town having risen in status to be the top-most Major Port among the 12 in the country owned by the Central Government, in terms of the total throughput (cargo volumes) handled in a given Financial Year - reckoned from the 1st April of any year to the 31st March of the subsequent year. That apart, the City had the honor of hosting the country's first major Ship-building Yard - the Hindustan Shipyard. It has other major petro-chemical and other notable industries, a major Refinery and a massive Steel Plant.

Rama Krishna Beach - RK Beach as it is called, is the most favorite Sea Fronts frequented by every citizen and visitor of Vizag - this being the British name for this fabulous City. The name of this beach came because of its proximity to the Sri Ramakrishna Mission premises. The immediate neighborhood is dotted with all the City's 5-Star Hotels. Apart from these beautiful hotels that provide lovely views of the Bay of Bengal on which rows and rows of Cargo Ships sail across the horizon, approaching to take berth in the Inner as well as the Outer Harbors of this Major Port - not far from this location - there are rows of high-rise residential apartments adding to the distinct beauty of Vizag Skyline-by-the-Sea! An evening spent on this beach is truly exciting, exhilarating and makes one forget the time! There are various attractions along the beach like eats and souvenirs to buy from and playgrounds for children. These aside, there is a disbanded old 1971 War-time Submarine which has been anchored by the coast, functioning as a very informative and educative Museum! The well-developed beach road provides a long drive leading to many other scenic spots alongside and leading to another beautiful Beach called Bhimili Beach towards the North. A visit to RK Beach is highly recommended as not to be missed. However, the authorities must provide more recreational and toilet facilities in the region to cater to the ever-increasing number of tourists. Another very important aspect to be taken care of is the frequent Beach Erosion caused by the mighty waves of the Bay of Bengal...!",RK Beach

,Naturally beautiful. Nothing more.,RK Beach
,"What I mean is that the beach is naturally beautiful, exotic, and lavish. But not at all well-maintained. Plastics and other wastage thrown all over the place.
The beach spread throughout the place gives you a marvellous look. The beach road nicely laid along the shore adds value. Hawkers all along will help you have a variety of food- from chat to corn. The places is surrounded by a number of hotels with all levels of quality.
Downside:
The heavy crowds the beach is usually occupied with, the too much moist atmosphere, not so friendly tidal movement, no amenities like bathrooms or lavatories, vehicular ruckus doesnt make the place not so lovable for a nature lover.

,"Sad Plight of Ramakrishna Beach, Visakhapatnam",RK Beach
,"I was at this beach 35 years ago. Not many people then in Vizag. It was a quiet sleepy town. Dolphin's Nose, the view from the Circuit House and the Beach - were some of its little attractions. At that time there was a little strip of beach, where we stood and enjoyed the waves. But even then nobody noticed that the beach was being eaten up by the angry sea. Why? I think Andhrites must learn one thing - stop defecating on the beaches! This filthy habit must go. Take the Chirala Vadarevu beach. There's lots of sand there, but you can't walk around without putting your foot in excrement. The smell makes you sick. So much for this dirty Andhra habit that's ruining the beaches on the shores of the Bay of Bengal.

At that time there was dirt on the Ramakrishna Beach, but since it was late in the evening and getting dark we didn't notice much. Just felt the cold water tingling our bare legs and shivered with excitement. That was 35 years ago.

A few days ago I went along the Beach Road and noticed the sea. It looked angry. The waves rather ferocious. There were the usual children's parks with the ugly Big Baby statues that some shallow-minded sculptor made. (Oh, the demented ideas of Government officials! They have no taste!) I noticed that the beach was just a thin strip and nobody was venturing near the waves. They were only feeling the spray. There was the usual flotsam and jetsam; the junk piled up by the tide at various pockets. There were notices warning people not to venture into the sea. There were the usual couples sitting on the beach road wall. The sky was grey. Nothing pleasant. I didn't step out of my car, except to a little park where three college students, a boy and two girls, were celebrating some birthday with a small cake (mostly icing) and some balloons. Loneliness pervaded the air.

I remember the good old times we had at Bhimili, way back in 1979. They say they have developed Rishikonda, but I didn't notice anything special about it. There's more of 'tourism' rather than natural attraction in these places. I mean 'artificial stuff' (tourism does that!) to attract 'artificial people' - those who are interested in eateries, a rusted submarine, temples, boring exhibitions, circuses, loony antics, and stuff like that.

I think the people of Vizag are living in a fool's paradise. Their beaches are being destroyed, but they want to make money desperately through 'tourism' - which is vengeful attempt by a thoughtless Government to destroy natural beauty. Vizag was once a beautiful place. It had all the advantages of Goa. The municipal commissioners have done a great job to improve the roads and the urban look of this coastal city. But no one really cares what happens to the beaches.

I think one day the angry sea will eat up the beach road and all those corroded beach apartment blocks that make such a depressing setting for Ramakrishna Beach, Visakhapatnam.",RK Beach
,deserves more time,RK Beach

,"The beaches in India are either too crowded or too dirty...there are of course few nice beaches left and Rama Krishna (RK in short) beach is one of them. Situated in the city of destiny Vizag, it is neatly maintained and still manages to have a good depth of beach. Noodles, Bajji and Mixture are some must eateries when you are off to this place.

,extremely crowded,RK Beach
,"If you persist and walk along the beach long enough, you might as well be fortunate enough to see some sewage water mix into the lovely Ocean waters.
The smell of kerosene lamps burning on beach makes it feel like you are back to those days when Indian trains put out so much smoke that your clothes started smelling soot with in the first half an hour of train journey.

The best place to sit is the stairs at the very entrance, take a good stroll and come back, I do not recommend any one to go into those waters. Go to Tenneti park, its awesome, its quite and its pleasing to the ears, eyes and mind.

,"The beach is ideal to look at but don't venture in the water. It is not clean, and in the evening take a walk. It is over crowded by late evening.",RK Beach
,Very Avoidable!,RK Beach
,"You can very freely avoid going to this beach, unless and until you have absolutely nothing else to do there, and of course if you like to be clicked with a gorilla statue! ;)",RK Beach
,Crowded beach,RK Beach

,Ramakrishna Beach,RK Beach
,"I always liked the marine drive in RK Beach from the first time I visited there. There are lots of restaurants offering snacks, tea even sea food. On the other side of the road there is Kali temple. Nearby Ramakrishna Mission from which probably the popular place got its name.Also an aqarium you can visit.",RK Beach

,The place where the crowd is in evening !,RK Beach
,"You have to visit RK beach (as it is called locally) just because it seems as if the whole city of vizag is present there in the evenings. It has many attractions alongside (temples, museums, parks, restaurants etc). It can get seriously crowded in evening and hence cleanliness might be an issue. But not to miss it since it is an important landmark.",RK Beach
,Very poor maintainence.,RK Beach
,"was very disappointed with the pollution in the beach. It was fully filled with plastic waste and was smelling filthy, It was said it was one of the main beaches in Vizag. but its maintenance was pathetic. Three were parks and other attractions but was not happy overall with the experience.",RK Beach

,RK beach or Ramakrishna beach in Vizag,RK Beach
,"Visited RK beach as it is commonly known in the month of March. It was a bit humid in Vizag but as expected it was cool on the beach. The beach is quite big; you can talk a walk for as long as you want and it won't end. The crowd was less during the forenoon. At some places we were alone on the beach. Enjoyed the waves which are big in that part. (Later read that the waves are dangerous in Vizag and has taken quite a few lives!). In the evening, there was beach volleyball going on. At one end of the beach is INS Kursura, a real submarine of Indian Navy that was retired in 2001 and converted into a museum. Was worth a visit and got to see the cramped and tough life seamen live inside a submarine. It was a great experience watching big waves during the full-moon tide.
It was a bit disturbing to see the people, mainly shop owners, throwing garbage in sea right at the beach. There were even some broken glass pieces strewn around.",RK Beach
,Beach beside city roads!,RK Beach
,"Since this beach is beside the city, it remains crowded. The water is clean, but due to the huge foot fall, the sand loses the surface smoothness. Ideal place for spending the evening, very easily accessible. Oh, there is beach volley court.",RK Beach
,Too crowded,RK Beach
,Very crowded in the evening. The lights from the city and the ships make it watchable otherwise too crowded for a sunday evening. The food quality of the street foods is terrible.,RK Beach
,Good for an evening walk,RK Beach
,"This used to be a nice quiet beach some time back. But not anymore. It can get quite crowded in the evenings. Traffic is also high on the road. But it is still worth taking a nice walk along the beach. Across the road, make sure to visit the Kali temple.",RK Beach
,This is same as Rama Krishna Beach,RK Beach
,"This is the main beach in Visakhapatnam. You can reach here from almost anywhere of the city using public transport too. You will find a lot of amusement, cafes, restaurants near by. Kali Temple, Naval Museum, Sub Marine Museum, Children's park. You have Varun INOX too near by with 6 screens, to watch a movie too. So over all. a beach with a lot of entertainment elements around.",RK Beach

,True Vizag Culture,RK Beach
,Vizag Culture!!! true style of Vizag. If Vizag had to be defined in short take them to RK Beach and show them this is Vizag. Exotically located on the beach road this beach is a killer and on it the crowd is like icing on top!!!!,RK Beach
,Beach with Sculptures,RK Beach
,"This is the only beach I have seen where there are sculptures o various types are installed through the length of the beach. I can not say they are the best, but they do provide variety. Beach is not safe and going too much into the sea is not recommended, but you can sit by the wall and admire it from a distance.",RK Beach
,"Fresh, clean and refreshing",RK Beach

A beach with a fantastic sunrise was totally inviting.

we all enjoyed the visit.",RK Beach

,"Its one of the good beaches in the city premises and for families and safety, it is the right beach compared to others. you can enjoy with a lot varieties of street food and weather. There are many temples, restaurants are situated near by it. There is one fish musium situated in its near opposite premises.",RK Beach
,Common man's beach,RK Beach
,The best part is that its easily accessible. Street food is available. Shivalayam & Kali temple are too good. Best place to watch how people from different age groups enjoy the beach. Movie Director's first call on the beach road. Caution: Deep & Rough Sea.,RK Beach
,Good to spend the evenings throughout the year.,RK Beach
,"The scenic beauty of the port city Visahkapatnam is mainly because of Bay of Bengal on it's eastern side.The wide stretches of the coastline and the main beach...Ramkrishna Beach is a wonderful place for the tourists.People can spend lot of time just looking at the horizon and the ships anchored at a distance anchorage. The Kali temple (opposite to the beach) is also a wonderful place to spend sometime.

Bathing is not at all advisable as per the warnings of the local authorities and the maintenance of the beach as well as the surruondings are not upto the mark .",RK Beach
,lasting memories,RK Beach
,"This is the one place I have been visiting since decades and it never fails to inspire.. I went there with my classmates, my wife, my professors, friends from abroad, my relatives, my kids and now with my grand children. the facade has changed but it remained as attractive as ever. at one time there was the quality restaurant there, where we spent many evenings, there were colour fountains, there was a cement train replica on which my children played. the restaurant changed, the fountains are gone the park replaced by a bus terminal, but the sea keeps smiling, I am the attraction, remember. The view as the car, bus, bike, whatever comes down the slope opposite is breathtaking.",RK Beach
,A clean city,RK Beach
,"The ramakrishna beach is quite clean and very centrally loocated. It is not safe for swimming. There are reasonably priced lodges and hotels near it. The city has many attractions and well laid out- but very few visit the Vimli(Vimunipattnam) beach which is about 30 KM away further to the Rishikonda beach.The drive to Vimli is picteresque , with the hills on one side and the sea on the other.The Vimli beach has many sculptures on it like of which I have not seen in any otherbeach. A view from the hilltop, known as Dolphin's nose is breathtaking. The amusement park on top of Kailashgiri is fantastic and the view from there is panoramic",RK Beach
,neat and clean beach,RK Beach
,This beach is very neat and clean and less croweded compared to rishikonda beach. vizag is itself a very beautiful city.,RK Beach
,Dirty and dangerous,RK Beach
,"This beach is famous amongst the locals as the location is central but otherwise there is nothing special about this place. Due to the horrible littering done by the tourists and the street vendors, you can see trash everywhere. You can see open drains draining their dirty water into the sea and people still bathe right next to them. The beach is also very dangerous as the sand level can go down abruptly. So non-swimmers need to be very careful while playing in the sea.",RK Beach
,A good beach but nothing exotic,RK Beach
,"RK Beach is worth a visit if you are in Vizag but there is nothing very great about it. Sand is soft but the sea is rough. For enjoying the sea waves and nearness to sea, it is worth a visit. For details please see my blog http://globalhindustani.blogspot.in/2013/01/35-rk-beach-vishakhapatnam-andhra.html",RK Beach
,Excellent,RK Beach
,"Very touristy. plenty of crowds in the evenings. Very Scenic and lots of street food available. Don't miss the ""Baggi"" stuffed with spicy onions! There is also a Aquarium, close bye. a nice Kali temple too. Very well connected by buses and auto-rickshaws.",RK Beach
,Vizags best attraction,RK Beach
,"Its a beautiful beach.but donot expect any international facilities near by.though you have AP tourism guest house near by with yummy food.i have been here many times and i enjoy this place a lot..you can directly go here from R.T.C Complex by catchinh 28 buses.their frequency is for every 10mins...
But,dont go so deep into wate ras the tides are high so please take some precautions",RK Beach
,Nice place,RK Beach
,"One of the good beach in Vizag, people are allowed to sit here for long but not swim. Sit on the beach at night and enjoy the view and the environment. Good for family time, romantic time. Avoid visiting during rush hours to enjoy the best.",RK Beach
,Very lovely beach,RK Beach
,Vast expanse of coastline; active waves splashing across the beach; fairly well maintained environment,RK Beach
,Well kept,RK Beach
,Fairly well kept region and evening stroll along the beach side is a great experience. Kids and families do make the most of this available evening spot.,RK Beach
,Entertaining beachfront,RK Beach
,"Lots of street foods, strolling amongst local young folks enjoying beachfront. Would recommend strolling around early morning when less crowded (most people are exercising) and sunrises, or later in the evening with crowds gathering to enjoy the cooler temps.",RK Beach
,Better enjoy it from a distance.,RK Beach
,"VERY Dirty. Don't go into the water as the land is too steep, plus waves are strong. Better enjoy it from a distance. Walk alongside the Beach Road from INS Kurusura towards Novotel and beyond. Worth it!! Roadside food includes Icecream stalls, bhelpuri, spiced mango pieces among a lot of other options. The breeze is good, ambience admirable but don't compare it with Marine Drive, Mumbai.",RK Beach
,"Sporty, full of life,",RK Beach
,"Likes:
you can enjoy beach; the way you want... one can get alone and enjoy the waves or one can get sporty and play",RK Beach
,A pleasant beach of Andhra Pradesh,RK Beach
,"Rama Krishna Beach or RK Beach (as commonly called) , Visakhapatnam, Andra Pradesh, India is very peaceful and pleasnt beach. Its name is taken from Rama- Krishna Mission which is located on the other side of the beach road.
Over a period of time number of well maintained parks have been developed as tourist attraction. Like any other beach, it is beautiful, nothing much special. However on the other side of the beach- road there are number of tourist attractions such as Aquarium, Kali Temple, Visakha museum etc. This beach has become famous for INS Kusura Submarine Museum which has been set-up at the coast. This museum is unique and 1st of its kind on subcontinent.
The beach good for swimming, sun bathing etc.",RK Beach
,perfect clean blue water,RK Beach
,"visakapatnam has very beautiful beaches. it is also one of them. its on the main road, very easily accessible.",RK Beach
,Good city beach,RK Beach
,"The RK beach is named after the Ramakrishna temple nearby. The beach front is good with many posh hotels in the vicinity. Compared to the Marine drive in Mumbai, this beach front is relatively cleaner and more scenic. The drive along the beach road gives you a high. Avoid going on Sunday evenings and on Holidays - it gets extremely crowded. I have been told that Rishi Konda beach which is a bit further down the road is far better, if you are planning for a swim. With the INS Kurusura submarine museum, many ships on the horizon, the dolphin nose hill makes this beach front good for a postcard scenery.",RK Beach
,Widely used,RK Beach
,The most common beach right in front of our hotel which has a good view but since it is easily accesible all the localites where present there so it is quite crowded,RK Beach
,To me this beach is not that good,RK Beach
,"this beach remains crowded. the people like me may not enjoy, less cleaner than rushikunda and yarada beach.",RK Beach
,good hangout,RK Beach
,"this is in the heart of the city and its named after the ramakrishna temple and also there are other temples along the stretch.. .there are houses/hotels/restaurants/parks,etc along this stretch and on weekends a lot of locals and tourists flock to the beach....
mind you, if you are a foreigner and expecting it to be like goa, its not , its southern india and conservative... you wont see pple in bikini or thongs, unless may be you are in the hotel's private premesis and be ready to get a lot of ogling if you are a good looking /fair skinned female......
language cud be a bit of a problem in the place as not many pple speak english ., especially when you want to commute by tuk tuk or taxi
overall its an good hangout place ...",RK Beach
,Most happening place in Vizag,RK Beach
,"This is the best place to be in Vizag. I would rate it one of the best beach road in India. It has its own culture , its own charm. One needs to be there to feel it. Everything that happens in Vizag happens at R K Beach. In last week of December, You can see Navy Day, a great program to watch.",RK Beach
,East coast,RK Beach
,"One of the beach on Bay of Bengal i have seen. Not different from the others but it have a unique display where I caught a view of eastern ghat, a port, a submarine all together. A unique experience. I may have seen this in another place in India, but first experience always beloved and cherishing.",RK Beach
,Okiee,RK Beach
,"If you are feeeling bored and have nothing to do you can take a stroll down this beach which is in the city itself

Nothing much to cheer about but worth a try once to kill time

There is a submarine which is displayed on the beach. It is now a museum",RK Beach
,Good and decent beach,RK Beach
,Stay there when you go with family as this beach is very close and around the city. The crowd here is always healthy from morning walk to night time. Taste the local food. Bengalis will have a good time as they will find Bengali food stalls there and also have a glance of Dakhineswar temple (A replica). But the sea here does not have the blueish color whereas Rushikonda and Tenati park the sea is real blue.,RK Beach
,"water is good, beach unclean",RK Beach
,"the water is very bluish and clean in this region but there is a lot of pollution that is destroying the beach. this beach in particular has lot of open drains flowing into it and you can actually see them. huge number of people from city come for visiting the place and so its heavily crowded. better visit rishikonda and some other beach(one near dolphin nose) those are much better in all respect - cleanliness, water, waves, ambiance, etc.",RK Beach

,Very Natural and Live,RK Beach
,"at a very close distance you can touch and feel water..

Morning or Evening just Chill and Relax. and enjoy the breeze of the smell of water.",RK Beach
,A disgusting swill of rubbish and effluent.,RK Beach
,"This beach should be avoided. In fact that goes for the whole town too. Having travelled extensively in India I can safely say that I have never seen such appalling industrial pollution (land, air and waterways) and filth emanating from the vast steel and petroleum complexes as well as from the choked waterways too full of rubbish to even flow. The beach is little better. Plastic and other unspeakable detritus abound and it has the feel of a misguided and tastelessly appointed beach resort. Do not believe the spin of the tourism websites that this is the Goa of the east or that the waters are blue - it could not be further from the truth. This place is a shameful example of how not to care for the environment or people unfortunate enough to have to live here.",RK Beach
,Lively and vibrant.,RK Beach
,"It's a busy beach with lots going on - stalls, games and people splashing in the sea. The promenade behind it is likewise busy, but plenty of space to stroll. The sand is lovely and the beach broad but there is a fair amount of rubbish around.",RK Beach

Once in year , one can also watch navy mela ( demonstration )

Very well maintained and nice place to spend. Very good scenery. You will feel how the movie being shot. Very clean and best place for family and couples. Entry fees is reasonable rather cheap. Hill top view of sea is the best. One of the best place to visit in Vizag,Ramanaidu Studio
Awesome place. The drive as awesome. View is spectacular. Bean board Cafe is a must visit. If u just want to visit Bean board then do not take ticket at the gate. Tell security you just want to visit bean board. Good parking space available on top too.,Ramanaidu Studio
Awasome place to visit in Vishakhapatnam is this film studio. A lot of movies were shoot here. It's situated a higher altitude than the actual sea level. Here you can spend a lot of time without feeling bored. The scenario of this place is mind blowing. Specially the view of the sea from here is just unbelievable.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Peaceful, the view is of an amazing ocean, town roads greenery... The visit was worthy. Small film studio. It has beautiful houses, photogallery and a cinema museum. Raasta aur manzil dono hi behtar h. Must visit",Ramanaidu Studio
The view was soo perfect but as it is Sunday today it's too rush and you probably have to wait for 20mins to find a place and then 20 mins to order and then like 30mins to get your order. The ambience and food is great & try visiting early ‚Ä¶,Ramanaidu Studio
Rama Naidu studios is situated on a hill top so the views from up there are so mesmerizing and beautiful .... The whole sea shore is visible and city too. There were mostly the film sets and not actual buildings and some shops also to have ‚Ä¶,Ramanaidu Studio
The film city is situated between the Ramkrishna Beach and Rishikonda Beach. A bit away from the main Visakhapatnam City. It is situated on the hill which is almoat 2km climb from the sea level. ‚Ä¶,Ramanaidu Studio

It is like okay. I mean i personally did not found it as such exciting. Not at all maintained. But yes on a random day for outing you can go.

"Ramanaidu studios is a big entity may be in Hyderabad, but again the one in Vizag is a very small one, i believe it was built for names sake. Nothing much happening quite here, just for a feel may be one can visit the location",Ramanaidu Studio
Not a worth place to visit as a tourist. It looks like a deserted place for shooting for films.,Ramanaidu Studio
Very nice studio for photo shoot and all also you can see gopala gopala bike on museum..üòò ‚Ä¶,Ramanaidu Studio
Located at top hill. Serene ambience. You may see the south stars too.,Ramanaidu Studio
"It is 15 km from RK Beach, it is good for a one time visit, it has all the set-ups which are used in movies, a kind of small film city.",Ramanaidu Studio
"It's great shooting spot for Movies and television shows in Vizag , South India. It's also a tourist spot and you will pay for you vehicles and the charge will be varied for vehicles.",Ramanaidu Studio
Nice place it was ... wonderful experience to watch the studio...there are many more antique camera.... video graphy equipment...there is also a jail present for shooting...aa huge palace is also there ....food stall also available but it is costly for normal people... weather is too good. ...park inside... roads are good condition,Ramanaidu Studio

"Spectacular views from the hill top. Entry is Rs.60 per adult. They have setups of Hospital, Jail, Shops etc.. Also have an art gallery of the artists. But washrooms are not maintained properly.",Ramanaidu Studio
A must visit for the fantastic view of the ocean. While the studio has many film set to offer for me the key driver has been the panoramic view of the ocean and the crisscross road through which you reach the spot,Ramanaidu Studio
"The journey to this place was satisfying with the cool breeze of the sea throughout the way.
The equipments used for the shoot were all secured and showcased for the visitors.",Ramanaidu Studio

Just for timepass.
Gives deep knowledge of movie shooting.",Ramanaidu Studio

"Very small and nothing there  to explore
But veiw and scenery from the place is nice",Ramanaidu Studio
Boring place. Dead studio. No maintenance. Just a waste of time and money. Would not recommend this to anyone. Although I saw loads of tourist coming here in big buses. Entry charge is 50 per adult. Use the 50 bucks to eat an ice cream instead while sitting on the beach. Do not go!,Ramanaidu Studio
A place where you can have fun in different demo movie set. The whole area is very decorated and clean. but the it can be more informative.,Ramanaidu Studio

Not recommend. It's not historical place so they should repair or reconstruct. All are damaged areas. Entry cost also high. Nothing to see there just normal buildings with damages.,Ramanaidu Studio
There is nothing much to see. Old buildings and not maintained well. Entry ticket is 50RS per person and not worth it. As it is on the hill it has great view point.,Ramanaidu Studio
"The scenic beauty of city is much more joy to the eyes from the hill top, towards the sea view as well as the IT SEZ SIDE. However, the film studio is not being maintained.",Ramanaidu Studio

"Definitely one gets the taste of a Film Studio, yet one   can find a great view of the beach and the whole city altogether. The bustling breeze may make you feel cold, even when the rest of Vizag is considerably warm. Also the wind is so strong that you may loose  control of you mobile phones while clicking pictures. So, be careful.",Ramanaidu Studio
Its a great view point but it is very badly maintained and the entry cost 50/- is totally not worth of it. Day by day this place is becoming couples / lovers spot. A great place for photography. Taking a Camera is beneficial.,Ramanaidu Studio

Boring place with no maintenance at all. All houses shops are in worst conditions. The only thing good here is the view from top. It's very far from city so better avoid going there and spend relaxing time on near by rushikonda beach.,Ramanaidu Studio
The most scenic place.The studio itself may not have wow factors about it.But the ocean view is amazing. No transport to reach the hill top.Better travel in own vehicle.,Ramanaidu Studio
"Film set was very descriptive, starting from police station, to Bangalow, to Toilet, to garden, and upto small rooms.",Ramanaidu Studio

Not maintained at all and they should close down or hand over to VUDA. May be it has good real estate value for the owners.
